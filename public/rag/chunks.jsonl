Background","content_type":"text","pages":"8-9","text":"1.1. Background\n\nGlobally, tuberculosis (TB) continues to be a significant public health problem. It has been estimated that about a quarter of the world’s population was infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) bacteria ( 1 ) . In 2023, an estimated 10.8 million infected individuals went on to develop TB disease, while 8.2 million were diagnosed and reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) ( 2 ) . Of those 8.2 million, an estimated 1 million people developed drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) – specifically, the form of DR-TB that is resistant to the first-line antibiotic isoniazid (INH) but susceptible to rifampicin (RIF) (i.e. Hr -TB) – and an additional 410 000 people developed TB disease resistant to both INH and RIF (i.e. multidrug-resistant TB [MDR-TB]), or to RIF alone (i.e. RIF-resistant TB [RR-TB]) ( 3 ) . Only two in five of the people estimated to have MDR-TB or RR-TB (MDR/RR-TB) were found and initiated on treatment, and only 55% of RR-TB patients received follow-on testing for resistance to the fluoroquinolones (FQs) as essential for diagnosis of pre-extensively drug-resistant TB (pre-XDR-TB). In addition, although the total number of deaths caused by TB fell from 1.32 million in 2022 to 1.25 million in 2023, the disease still probably overtook coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as the world’s leading cause of death due to a single infectious agent ( 2 ) .\n\nIn support of addressing these gaps, WHO’s global strategy for TB prevention, care and control for 2015–2035 – known as the End TB Strategy ( 4 ) – calls for the early detection of TB infection, diagnosis of TB and universal access to drug susceptibility testing (DST). To meet the End TB Strategy targets:\n\n• individuals living with TB infection who are at higher risk of progression to active TB should receive TB infection testing to identify those who will benefit most from TB preventive treatment (TPT );\n\n• WHO-recommended rapid diagnostic tests (WRDs) should be made available to all individuals with signs or symptoms of, or who screen positive for, TB;\n\n• individuals with bacteriologically confirmed TB should receive testing for resistance to RIF;\n\n• people with RR-TB should receive testing for resistance to the FQs; and\n\n• individuals with pre-XDR-TB should receive testing for resistance to bedaquiline (BDQ) and linezolid (LZD), and to all other drugs that might be included in their treatment regimen ( 3 ) .\n\nSection 2 of this handbook outlines TB tests, with WHO recommendations for the detection of TB infection, disease and drug resistance; Section 3 outlines considerations for the implementation of these tests.\n\nIn addition, the first WHO standard on universal access to rapid TB diagnostics was issued in 2023 ( 3 ) . The standard emphasizes the need to undertake a comprehensive approach to diagnostics while following the care cascade and closing all gaps; for example, availability and access to quality-assured testing and DST, testing capacity, rapid turnaround time for results and monitoring of indicators. Furthermore, the framework of indicators and targets for laboratory strengthening under the End TB Strategy ( 4 ) highlights that all national TB programmes (NTPs) should prioritize the development of a network of TB laboratories that use modern methods of diagnosis (e.g. molecular methods and liquid culture), have efficient referral systems, use electronic data and diagnostics connectivity, use standard operating procedures (SOPs) and appropriate quality assurance (QA) processes, adhere to biosafety principles for all testing and have sufficient human resources. These priorities should be comprehensively addressed in national strategic plans and should be adequately funded. Practical considerations for implementing and strengthening these essential testing programme elements are further detailed in Section 3 and Section 4 , respectively.","tokens_est":972,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Background","content_type":"text","pages":"9","text":"1.1. Background (cont)\n\nIn addition to universal access to TB diagnostic testing services, both the WHO standard and recent guidelines on TB diagnosis continue to highlight the need for universal DST, especially for the medicines for which mWRDs are available (ideally, performed before treatment is started while not delaying treatment initiation when waiting for results) ( 5 ) . WHO recently approved the use of targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) as a follow-on technology for the detection of drug resistance ( Section 2 ) ( 6 ) . Targeted NGS solutions couple the amplification of selected genes with NGS technology, and can detect resistance to many drugs using a single processed sputum sample ( 6 ) . Because these tests can interrogate entire genes to identify specific mutations associated with resistance, targeted NGS may be more accurate than other mWRDs . In addition to detection of resistance to first-line TB drugs, current recommendations support the use of this technology for the rapid detection of resistance to three of the drugs used in the BPaLM regimen (i.e. BDQ, LZD and moxifloxacin [MFX]); therefore, this handbook includes further implementation considerations and algorithms using this technology. Of note, the fourth BPaL /M drug – pretomanid (Pa) – has recently had criteria established for DST, and these details are also included in this document ( Web Annex B ). Based on current treatment recommendations, countries embarking on interventions to detect and treat DR-TB should, in addition, establish laboratory capacity to perform culture-based phenotypic DST for drugs that are recommended for use in MDR-TB regimens ( 7 ) and for which there are reliable phenotypic DST methods (e.g. BDQ, LZD, Pa, cycloserine [Cs], clofazimine [CFZ] and delamanid [DLM]). Lastly, countries should expand their capacity to monitor the culture conversion of people being treated for DR-TB.","tokens_est":479,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Advances in TB diagnostic test development, assessment and WHO recommendations\n\nOver recent decades, considerable effort has gone into building the laboratory, clinical and programmatic capacity to prevent, detect and treat TB infection, TB disease and DR-TB. Many tools and guidance documents have been developed, including the recently consolidated and updated guidelines for the treatment of TB ( 8 ) ; blood-based tests for TB infection that incorporate chemiluminescent methods for result detection; urine-based biomarker\n\npoint-of-care (POC) tests for TB detection among people living with HIV; low-complexity tests that can use stool samples from children to detect TB and resistance to RIF; low-complexity tests that laboratories with basic infrastructure can use to detect resistance to RIF, INH, FQs, ethionamide (ETO) and amikacin (AMK); genomic sequencing technologies that incorporate resistance interpretation analyses that consider advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of drug resistance; and consolidated model diagnostic testing algorithms and guidance for implementing testing programmes that are tailored to the purpose of testing and characteristics of the patient population (e.g. age, HIV status and risk of drug resistance).\n\nUntil 2024, the operational guidance that supported advancing WHO policy on testing for TB infection, diagnosis and drug resistance was presented separately (in operational handbooks on tests for TB infection, and on tests for TB diagnosis and drug resistance). This handbook is the first to combine and update this operational guidance into a single reference document. In addition, an increasing number of novel TB tests may be used for the purposes listed above; hence, the WHO Global Programme on Tuberculosis & Lung Health (WHO/ GTB) has adopted “class-based recommendations” that apply to TB testing products with similar characteristics and performances. In addition, WHO prequalification (PQ) has been established to assess whether each testing product within a class, and the process used to manufacture that product, meet performance and quality standards ( 9 ) . This approach to TB test assessment, recommendation and PQ is expected to increase competitiveness in price, quality and services.\n\nNew TB testing products will continue to be reviewed for class determination by WHO/ GTB, by comparing their characteristics with those of the existing diagnostic classes. If the characteristics differ sufficiently to warrant a new class, the product will be assessed as “first in class” using a standardized, Pathway A, WHO/GTB guideline development process, supported by a guideline development group (GDG). If the characteristics are sufficiently similar to an existing class, the product will be characterized as “within class” and may be referred directly to PQ. If a WHO PQ process has not yet been established for a given class, then WHO/GTB will oversee an interim within-class assessment of evidence with the support of the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on TB Diagnostics and Laboratory Strengthening. Further details on class determination and product assessments are available in the 2025 publication, WHO consolidated guidelines on tuberculosis: module 3: diagnosis ( 5 ) .","tokens_est":815,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Advances in TB diagnostic test development, assessment and WHO recommendations (cont)\n\nIn 2024 and early 2025, WHO oversaw both first-in-class and within-class assessments. Through the first-in-class assessment, two new classes of low-complexity nucleic acid amplification tests were established. Both classes include testing products previously endorsed by WHO for the detection of TB with and without RIF resistance (i.e. Xpert® MTB/RIF Ultra, Molbio Truenat® MTB Plus and MTB-RIF Dx, and TB-LAMP) ( Section 2 ). There are also new recommendations on concurrent testing of respiratory and non-respiratory samples among adults and adolescents with HIV, children with HIV, and children without HIV or with unknown HIV status. These populations experience significant burdens of TB, increased risk of TB-associated morbidity and mortality, and challenges with sputum production; in addition, they may produce sputa with low and variable amounts of bacteria. Hence, concurrent testing may increase patient access to testing services through the included use of easy-to-collect urine and stool samples, while improving the accuracy of TB detection by using more than one sample and test.\n\nPractical considerations for implementation of the concurrent testing recommendations are presented in Section 3 and are reflected in the revised model diagnostic algorithms and decision pathways given in Section 6 .\n\nIn addition, the 2025 within-class assessment evaluated new interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) for the detection of TB infection, and new and updated targeted NGS solutions for the detection of DR-TB. WHO recommendations for the class of IGRAs now apply to two new tests (SD Biosensor STANDARD E TB-Feron ELISA and Diasorin /QIAGEN LIAISON QFT-PLUS CLIA), which expand the list of WHO-recommended tests for TB infection and introduce the chemiluminescent detection method for IGRA testing for the first time. The recommendations for the class of targeted NGS apply to one updated solution (Oxford Nanopore Technologies AmPORE -TB) that can now be used to detect resistance to a wider range of TB drugs. Policy statements on the performance of the new technologies are summarized in the relevant portions of Section 2 , new within-class products are highlighted in the full list of TB diagnostic classes and testing technologies in Table 2.1 , and the TAG meeting and evidence review reports are provided in Web Annex D .\n\nThe full list of current TB testing recommendations is presented, with policy details, in the 2025 publication, WHO consolidated guidelines on tuberculosis: module 3: diagnosis ( 5 ) and in Table 1.1 .","tokens_est":660,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

TB tests with WHO recommendations","content_type":"text","pages":"18-19","text":"2. TB tests with WHO recommendations\n\nWHO has reviewed each of these tests and solutions and has developed recommendations for their use. In all settings, WHO recommends that rapid diagnostic tests should be used for initial diagnosis of TB and detection of RIF resistance, to minimize delays in starting treatment.\n\nThe initial tests for TB diagnosis are broadly grouped as WRDs; these are defined as diagnostic tests that directly target mycobacterial DNA (molecular) or cell components (biomarkers) to aid in the diagnosis of TB ( 5 ) . The newer, sensitive molecular tests recommended for the initial detection of Mtb complex (MTBC) – with and without initial drug-resistance detection – are mWRDs and are organized into three classes ( 5 ):\n\n• the low-complexity automated NAATs (LC- aNAATs ) for the detection of MTBC and RIF resistance;\n\n• the moderate-complexity automated NAATs (MC- aNAATs ) for the detection of MTBC and RIF and INH resistance; and\n\n• the low-complexity manual NAATs (LC- mNAATs ) for the detection of MTBC alone.\n\nIn addition to the mWRDs , one biomarker-based LF-LAM WRD – Determine TB LAM Ag – is recommended for diagnosis of TB in people living with HIV. A positive LF-LAM result is considered to be bacteriological confirmation of TB ( 10 ) . However, a negative result does not rule out TB; therefore, LF-LAM is recommended for concurrent use with mWRD testing among people living with HIV. Policy guidance on the LF-LAM testing was recently updated and is detailed in the WHO consolidated guidelines on tuberculosis: module 3: diagnosis ( 5 ) , while operational considerations are provided in Section 3 and Section 4 of this handbook. After the initial detection of TB, three classes of follow-on tests are recommended to detect resistance to first-line or second-line anti-TB drugs (or both): LC- aNAATs , line probe assays (LPAs) and targeted NGS end-to-end solutions, see Table 2.1 and Table 2.2 . A summary of the aspects of the tests included in the classes is found in Table 2.6 ; information sheets specific to the targeted NGS solutions are provided in Web Annex A .\n\nTo detect when a person is infected with Mtb and may be most likely to benefit from receiving TPT, WHO recommends three classes of TB infection tests: TBSTs, IGRAs and TST. All three classes include tests that target factors associated with a person’s immune response to infection – they do not directly target components of Mtb . Hence, tests for TB infection require a competent immune response to produce valid results, cannot distinguish TB infection from TB disease, and cannot predict who will progress from TB infection to TB disease. Further information on the recommendations for use of these tests can be found in the WHO consolidated guidelines on tuberculosis: module 1: prevention ( 14 ). More information concerning operational considerations on testing for TB infection is outlined in Section 2.5 below.","tokens_est":733,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Conventional tests for the diagnosis of TB\n\nIn many high TB burden settings, sputum smear microscopy remains the primary diagnostic technique for evaluating individuals who present with the signs and symptoms of TB, or screen positive for TB. However, sputum smear microscopy is an insensitive test, with a limit of detection ( LoD ) of 5000–10 000 bacilli/mL of sputum ( 16 ) . Furthermore, sputum smear microscopy cannot distinguish drug-susceptible strains from drug-resistant strains. WHO continues to recommend that NTPs replace microscopy as the initial diagnostic test with WRDs that directly detect MTBC.\n\nThe current gold standard method for bacteriological confirmation of TB is culture using commercially available liquid media. However, culture is not used as a primary diagnostic test in many high TB burden countries because of the cost, the infrastructure requirements (biosafety level 3 [BSL-3] or TB containment laboratory) and the long time required to generate results (1–3 weeks for a positive result and up to 6 weeks for a negative result). Nevertheless, culture is important for the diagnosis of paediatric and extrapulmonary TB from paucibacillary samples, and in the differential diagnosis of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infection. Additionally, both sputum smear microscopy and culture remain necessary to monitor a person’s response to treatment.\n\nThe culture process can result in the growth of many different Mycobacterium species. As such, laboratory confirmation of TB requires testing of the recovered mycobacteria using a species identification test (e.g. Capilia ™ TB-Neo, Tauns Laboratories, Numazu, Japan; Bioline ™ TB Ag MPT64 Rapid Test, Abbott, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea; or TBcID , Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Sparks, United States of America [USA]) to definitively identify MTBC. Species identification is particularly important before initiating phenotypic DST.\n\n2.

Initial tests for diagnosis of TB with drug resistance detection | 2.2.1. Low-complexity automated NAATs","content_type":"text","pages":"22-23","text":"2.2.1. Low-complexity automated NAATs\n\nWHO recommends the use of the LC- aNAAT class for detecting pulmonary TB and extrapulmonary TB in adults, children (defined as those aged <10 years), and people (of all ages) living with HIV ( Box 2.1 ). For adult pulmonary TB, the summary sensitivity was 90.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 88.0–92.4) and the summary specificity was 94.9% (95% CI: 93.0–96.3). The two tests that meet the criteria for inclusion in the class – Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) and Truenat MTB Plus with MTB-RIF Dx – also detect resistance to RIF. For Xpert Ultra, this is achieved by integrating the detection of MTBC and mutations in the RIF-resistance\n\ndetermining region (RRDR) in one cartridge. For the Truenat test, reflex testing with the MTB-RIF Dx assay should follow a positive MTB Plus result. The class summary sensitivity for the detection of RIF resistance is 95.1% (95% CI: 83.1–98.7) and the summary specificity is 98.1% (95% CI: 97.0–98.7).\n\nWhen using LC- aNAATs to diagnose TB among children, concurrent testing of one respiratory specimen (i.e. sputum, gastric aspirate or nasopharyngeal aspirate) and one stool sample is recommended. If a child is HIV-positive, the concurrent testing strategy should also include LF-LAM testing on a urine sample (see Section 3.4 ). Concurrent testing of a respiratory sample (using LC- aNAAT ) and urine (using LF-LAM) is also recommended for adults and adolescents living with HIV (see Section 3.4 ).\n\nLC- aNAATs are also recommended for the detection of TB meningitis using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and extrapulmonary TB using lymph node aspirates, pleural tissue, pleural fluid, synovial aspirates, peritoneal fluid or pericardial fluid. It is important to stress that the bacillary load of extrapulmonary samples is often low; therefore, samples with sufficient volumes for testing should be collected and concentrated, where possible, to reach a detectable level of bacterial DNA.\n\nWhen implementing these tests, users should be aware that the instruments required to run the tests have different requirements for laboratory infrastructure. For example, the GeneXpert instrument requires a dust-free environment, a stable electricity supply, and a maximum temperature of 30 °C, whereas the Trueprep and Truelab instruments can be battery operated and are less sensitive to the surrounding temperature (see Table 2.2 ). Some LC- aNAAT instrumentation may also be used to test for other diseases (e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2], HIV, and hepatitis B and C), which can facilitate one-stop-shop services for patients and cost-sharing measures between disease programmes .\n\nStaff running the tests need to have a basic understanding of the principles of molecular testing and know how to operate a computer. Low-complexity tests may have different pipetting requirements; for example, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra does not require precision pipetting, whereas Molbio Truenat MTB Plus requires precision pipetting of a small volume of liquid. Maintenance and annual calibration are required; thus, manufacturers or countries often train “super users” to oversee or perform a basic service and annual calibration. Service contracts with manufacturers are also available, some of which bundle instrument service and maintenance costs into a transparent per-test unit cost.","tokens_est":845,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

New products that are successfully added to the class by WHO PQ can be found in the WHO list of prequalified in vitro diagnostic products ( 18 ) .\n\nThe LC- mNAATs are accurate in detecting pulmonary TB on respiratory samples in adults, children and people living with HIV ( Box 2.3 ). Currently, such tests are only recommended for use with sputum (all ages) and gastric aspirate (children) because evidence on other sample types is lacking (see the section on further research in the consolidated guidelines ( 5 ) ). The manual TB-LAMP assay is designed to detect MTBC directly from sputum specimens in about 90 minutes, does not require sophisticated instrumentation and can be used at the peripheral laboratory level, with the biosafety requirements being similar to those for sputum smear microscopy. For the detection of TB in adults with signs and symptoms consistent with pulmonary TB, LC- mNAAT demonstrated a sensitivity of 84% (95% credible interval [ CrI ]: 78–89%) and a specificity of 96% (95% CrI : 94–97%) on sputum, as compared with a microbiological reference standard.","tokens_est":357,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

In addition, the test provides results in less than 90 minutes, meaning that the time to results is faster than with LPAs or culture-based phenotypic DST.

Thus, Xpert MTB/XDR could be used as a reflex test to complement existing technologies that only test for RIF resistance, allowing the rapid and accurate detection of resistance to INH and FQs in cases of RIF-susceptible TB; and of resistance to FQ, INH, ETO and AMK in cases of RR-TB. The package insert includes the use of the test on culture isolates.

WHO policy statement on targeted NGS solutions for detection of DR-TB, 2025\n\nRecently, new and updated targeted NGS solutions for TB drug resistance testing have become available. WHO solicited information on these technologies directly from manufacturers and through a public call for information. In addition, a systematic review of published and unpublished literature was conducted. All available evidence was assessed by a TAG in January 2025. Products that had sufficient independent evidence for consideration were AmPORE -TB (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and DeepChek Assay 13-Plex KB Drug Susceptibility Testing (ABL Diagnostics SA).\n\nFollowing TAG review and advice, WHO makes the following policy statements:\n\n1. The performance of the AmPORE -TB (ONT) end-to-end solution is comparable to that of other WHO-recommended targeted NGS solutions for the detection of resistance to RIF, INH, FQs and PZA among people with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB.\n\n2. The performance of the AmPORE -TB (ONT) end-to-end solution is comparable to that of WHO-recommended targeted NGS solutions for the detection of resistance to INH, FQs, BDQ, LZD, CFZ, PZA, AMK and STR among people with RR-TB.\n\n3. The performance of the DeepChek Assay 13-Plex KB Drug Susceptibility Testing (ABL Diagnostics SA) solution could not be adequately compared to that of WHO-recommended targeted NGS solutions for the detection of drug resistance among people with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB, with or without RIF resistance.\n\n4. Current WHO recommendations for the use of targeted NGS are valid for the AmPORE -TB (ONT) solution, which now meets class-based performance criteria for detection of resistance to three additional drugs (PZA, BDQ and CFZ).\n\nRemarks:\n\n AmPORE -TB performance was not comparable to that of the tNGS class for detection of resistance to ethambutol, so a statement on resistance detection for this drug was not made in either population.\n\n The decision on AmPORE -TB regarding streptomycin was not unanimous due to concerns about the relatively lower sensitivity compared with class performance criteria. However, considering this is a last resort drug, and pDST results take longer to become available, it was considered acceptable for inclusion.\n\n The decision on DeepCheck comparability was based on the high sample and drug-specific failure rates that occurred across the entire range of Xpert MTB/ RIF semiquantitative categories when compared with those for the class of tNGS solutions. The review team and TAG were unable to assess whether the indeterminate rates were due to site-specific differences. Notably the three evaluation sites used different DNA extraction methods; however, the impact of the methodology difference could not be individually assessed for impact apart from other factors that varied between study sites. WHO welcomes a future submission from the manufacturer with more independent evidence on the performance of the end-to-end solution. If multiple extraction methods are used, data on the extraction method performance and equivalence may be required.\n\n The analysis software for tNGS end-to-end solutions is anticipated to be updated with new versions of the WHO Mutations Catalogue; these updates are expected to improve solution performance for detection of resistance over time but will have to be evaluated.","caption":"Box 2.9.

Among people with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB, the targeted NGS test performances ( Table 3.3 , Table 3.4 and Table 3.5 in Section 3 ) were determined to be accurate for all drugs included in the assessment, with pooled sensitivity of at least 95% for INH, MFX and ethambutol (EMB); more than 93% for RIF and levofloxacin (LFX); and 88% for PZA. The pooled specificity was at least 96% for all drugs. The reference standard was phenotypic DST for INH, LFX and MFX, and a combination of phenotypic DST and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for RIF, PZA and EMB. The indeterminate rate ranged from 7% (AMK) to 18% (PZA) but was highest in samples with low or very low bacterial loads, which may have implications for implementation; therefore, priority should be given to samples with a higher bacillary load. The overall certainty of the evidence ranged from low to moderate for test accuracy.\n\nAmong people with bacteriologically confirmed RIF-resistant pulmonary TB, the targeted NGS test performances ( Table 3.6 in Section 3 ) were determined to be accurate for INH, LFX, MFX, streptomycin (STR) and EMB (pooled sensitivity ≥95%), and acceptable for BDQ (68%), LZD (69%), CFZ (70%), AMK (87%) and PZA (90%). The specificity was at least 95% for all drugs except STR (75%). The reference standard was phenotypic DST for all drugs except EMB and PZA, where a combination of phenotypic DST and WGS was used.

Currently, the available mWRDs for DST can be used to detect specific mutations known to confer phenotypic resistance. Rapid molecular tests for resistance to RIF, INH and FQ can be implemented in decentralized settings; such tests can deliver rapid results to inform the selection of the initial treatment regimen while awaiting follow-on DST for other anti-TB drugs.\n\nDNA sequencing using NGS technologies is a method for the detection of mutations associated with drug resistance for many anti-TB drugs ( 32 ) . NGS-based DST could reduce the need for phenotypic DST for patient-care decisions; it may be particularly useful for drugs for which phenotypic DST is unreliable or for settings that do not have the capacity to perform phenotypic DST.\n\nNGS refers to techniques that rely on the sequencing of multiple DNA fragments in parallel, followed by bioinformatics analyses to assemble the sequences. The technologies can be used to determine the nucleotide sequence of an entire genome (i.e. WGS) or part of a genome (i.e. targeted NGS) in a single sequencing run. WGS and targeted NGS are recommended for use in the surveillance of DR-TB and for DST.\n\nWGS is a powerful tool for detecting mutations and it serves as a reference test for confirming mutations; however, it depends on having a culture isolate and is impacted by delays in growing the organism ( 33 ) . The WHO mutation catalogue ( 23 ) provides a standardized methodology for the analytical pipeline for analysis of NGS results and interpretation of mutations. The tools can be used both for WGS and targeted NGS.\n\nPhenotypic DST remains important for classifying resistance, particularly for new drugs where resistance is not fully elucidated. As more phenotypic DST data are matched with WGS data in the catalogue, the performance of the catalogue and the utility of WGS for new drugs will improve. Contributors are encouraged to upload data to the TB sequencing portal ( 34 ) .\n\nUse of WGS and phenotypic DST is now the reference standard for RIF and PZA owing to the limitations of phenotypic DST alone for these drugs.\n\nSection 2.4.4 describes the targeted NGS tests for the detection of resistance to anti-TB medicines recently recommended by WHO for use directly on clinical samples. These tests can detect mutations associated with resistance to RIF, INH, PZA, EMB, FQ, BDQ, LZD, CFZ, AMK and STR.

Tests for TB infection","content_type":"text","pages":"56-57","text":"2.6. Tests for TB infection\n\nTB infection is a state of persistent immune response to Mtb antigens with no evidence of clinically manifest TB disease ( 35 ) . People with TB infection have no signs or symptoms of TB disease, are not infectious, have normal or stable images on chest X-ray (CXR), and have negative microbiological tests (if such tests are performed). It is estimated that about 25% of the world’s population has been infected with Mtb ( 1 ) , of whom 5–10% will develop TB disease over their lifetime ( 36 ) . This risk is much higher in those with certain epidemiological factors (e.g. recent contact with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB), social characteristics (low socioeconomic status or malnutrition) and demographical characteristics (e.g. very young children or the elderly) or clinical conditions that compromise the immune system (e.g. HIV infection, diabetes or immunosuppressive medications) ( 37–39 ) .\n\nAmong people with such risk factors, TPT can provide important individual and public health benefits. However, implementing TPT raises various challenges in terms of programme prioritization, reluctance of health workers to treat people who are asymptomatic, medication adherence, availability of appropriate drugs and formulations, costs, demands on health systems and the individuals concerned, and access to free screening and testing for TB infection. TPT can induce adverse drug reactions (although these are rarely serious) in people who are generally healthy. Hence, TPT is recommended only for groups who are at high risk of developing TB disease, in whom the benefits of TPT clearly outweigh the risks.\n\nThe risk of TB disease is higher in those who have a positive test for TB infection than in those with the same risk factors but a negative test for TB infection. In addition, it is useful to test for TB infection because individuals who test positive are more likely to benefit from TPT than those who test negative; thus, TPT will be of greatest individual and public health benefit if it is directed by an assessment of risk alongside the results of testing for TB infection. Hence, the extension of TPT creates a need to expand the capacity to test for TB infection. However, the absence of TB infection testing should not prevent the use of TPT, particularly for TB contacts aged below 5 years and people living with HIV ( 41 ) .\n\nWHO recommends three classes of tests for TB infection: TST, TBSTs and IGRAs ( Box 2.12 ).

The performance of the STANDARD E TB-Feron ELISA and LIAISON QFT-PLUS (CLIA) is comparable to that of WHO-recommended IGRAs for the detection of TB infection.

The performance of the ASACIR.TB, ichroma IGRA-TB (FIA), Wantai TB-IGRA (CLIA), and AvanSureI3 TB-IGRA (CLIA) could not be adequately compared with that of WHO-recommended IGRAs for the detection of TB infection.\n\n15. Current WHO recommendations for the use of IGRAs are also valid for SD Biosensor’s STANDARD E TB-Feron ELISA and Diasorin’s LIAISON QFT-PLUS (CLIA).\n\nIn addition to the implementation considerations the GDG made in 2011 when IGRAs were recommended for use ( 5 ) , the TAG listed additional factors during its meeting in January 2025, as outlined below.\n\nRemarks:\n\n Due to the lack of sufficient data for four of the tests: ASACIR.TB (ELISA), ichroma IGRA-TB (FIA), AdvanSure i3 TB-IGRA (CLIA) and Wantai TB-IGRA (CLIA), the TAG could not adequately compare their performance to that of current WHO recommended IGRAs; this does not imply any concerns with the tests themselves but rather a lack of sufficient independent data to make a recommendation.. WHO welcomes future submissions by the manufacturers when additional independent data are available.\n\n The primary analysis compared paired results of the index test with a reference test; it included a difference in sensitivity and specificity that was considered helpful for this comparative evaluation, particularly when the prevalence of TB infection varied by study population.\n\n The comparative evaluations did not assess test performance in subgroups (e.g. people living with HIV, children and other immunocompromised populations); however, data from these groups were included where available.\n\n The studies for the LIAISON QFT-PLUS were from low-burden TB settings; comparative evaluation data from high-burden settings were noted as desirable to diversify the evidence on test performance and inform uptake of new testing technologies.\n\n The study for the Wantai TB-IGRA (CLIA) was from a single, large, high-burden country (China).\n\n No data on predictive accuracy for development of active TB were available for any of the tests, highlighting a continued gap in research.\n\n A high risk of bias was observed for all studies, irrespective of the index test evaluated.\n\n The advantages and disadvantages of blood-based IGRAs compared with skin-based TB infection tests apply to all index tests.\n\n Indeterminate result rates need to be considered because these have implications for patient and health system costs.","caption":"Box 2.14.

Tests WHO recommends against using or recommends limited usage\n\nBased on reviews of available data, WHO has recommended against using tests that do not provide reliable information for diagnosing TB. In 2011, WHO recommended that commercial serological tests should not be used for the diagnosis of pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB because the commercial serodiagnostic tests available at that time provided inconsistent and imprecise findings, there was no evidence that using those commercial serological assays improved patient outcomes, and the tests generated high proportions of false positive and false negative results that may have an adverse impact on people’s health ( 53 ) .\n\nWHO recommendations are specific for intended uses; sometimes, even a test that is recommended is not recommended to be used for a specific purpose. For example, the various classes of NAATs (LC- aNAAT , LC- mNAAT and MC- aNAAT ) are not recommended for use in monitoring the response to treatment.\n\nWHO’s recommendation is that tests for TB infection may be used in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) to aid in the detection of TB infection.

Pretest probability and test accuracy considerations\n\nThe predictive values of a test vary depending on the prevalence of TB in the population being tested. The prevalence of TB in a country is best estimated through a national TB prevalence survey. Countries should conduct prevalence surveys about every 10 years. If a survey has not been conducted recently, WHO provides estimates of prevalence in its annual global TB report ( 2 ) . These estimates are based on the number of notified TB cases submitted each year by Member States. However, the number of notified cases is not a good proxy for the actual number of people who develop TB disease. Both underreporting of diagnosed TB (especially in the private sector) and underdiagnosis (especially in countries with geographical or financial barriers to seeking and accessing health care) will affect the reported numbers and thus the estimates. Also, figures provided by WHO are national, and regional variations in prevalence may warrant the use of different tests in different regions.\n\nmodule 3: diagnosis ( 5 ) . Table 3.2 , Table 3.3 and Table 3.4 provide those same parameters for detection of resistance to RIF, INH and FQs, respectively. Table 3.5 and Table 3.6 provide the parameters for detection of resistance to first-line and second-line anti-TB agents using targeted NGS end-to-end solutions and tests. The sensitivity of the test may be lower when used for active case-finding in a population-screening context because such people would be less ill and have a lower bacillary burden. In choosing a test to implement, each country will need to consider the possible trade-offs between higher or lower sensitivity and higher or lower specificity, based on the prevalence of TB in their country ( Box 3.1 ). False negative results may lead to missed opportunities to treat TB, whereas false positive results may lead to the overtreatment of people who do not have TB. In some settings, countries may need to conduct additional modelling work to support decisions on implementation strategies, based on the trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity in their settings.\n\nIn addition to geographical variability, differences in the approach to screening for TB disease may also affect the predictive value of TB testing. Usually, a decision to undertake a diagnostic work-up of an individual for TB begins with assessing symptoms and signs of TB disease. However, many individuals with culture-positive TB may not have symptoms or may consider the symptoms too insignificant to report, leading to missed opportunities for diagnosis. To improve TB case detection and identify individuals suitable for TPT, WHO has updated the TB screening guidelines ( 54 ) . Several modalities are recommended for screening all people for TB, including the four-symptom screen, CXR ( Box 3.2 ) and mWRDs ; for screening of people living with HIV, additional testing for positive C-reactive protein testing (>5 mg/L) may be considered.","tokens_est":748,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

In a cohort of 1000 individuals there will be 25 people with TB and 975 people without TB. The test in this example has a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 96%. Of the 25 people who are TB positive, 22 people with TB are estimated to be detected (i.e. 25 × 0.90 = 22). These are the true positive (TP) results. The three people who are TB positive but were undetected are the false negative (FN) results. Thus, in this cohort, 975 people will not have TB (i.e. 1000 – 25 = 975). The specificity of 96% results in 936 people being true negative (TN) (i.e. 975 × 0.96 = 936). The results for the remaining 39 people (i.e. 975–936 = 39) will be false positive (FP). In summary, of the 62 people diagnosed with TB, only 23 will be TP (i.e. 23 [TP] + 39 [FP] = 62), giving a positive predictive value (PPV) of 37%.\n\nExample 2\n\nIn this example, the prevalence is estimated to be 20% in a TB hospital where many clients present with TB symptoms.

Planning for and implementing quality-assured TB testing services\n\nAs part of a wider quality management system (QMS) for testing services, quality assurance (QA) is defined as a set of planned and systematic activities to ensure that organizational quality requirements are met; this enables laboratories to maintain accuracy, reliability and reproducibility of results. Essential QA activities include training and competency assessments for staff, equipment verification and maintenance, method validation, lot testing for reagents, routine QC procedures, EQA such as proficiency testing, monitoring of quality indicators and continuous quality improvement actions. Cyclical feedback and corrective actions are crucial for sustaining and strengthening QA processes. These essential activities enhance confidence among clinicians and patients who rely on diagnostic services to guide decisions about care and treatment, which can in turn enhance demand for, and the impact of, clinical tests for patient management.\n\nKey ongoing QA challenges in resource-limited settings include inconsistent practices, lack of systematic collection or monitoring of laboratory indicators, insufficient resource allocation for QC and EQA, and variability in the quality and timeliness of training and competency assessment provided to testing and clinical staff.\n\nTo address these challenges, programmes should review and budget for QA needs early in the processes for test consideration, selection and placement. Annex 1 provides budgeting considerations for TB tests, and the GLI planning and budgeting tool ( 55 ) for projecting test-related costs, including required and recommended test-specific cost considerations. In addition, the GLI has produced a dashboard of EQA panels and programmes for TB tests (with details and contact information for providers), to help programmes select and budget for EQA service provision ( 56 ) . Lastly, close collaboration between testing and clinical programmes , as well as between TB and other disease programmes where relevant, should be sought out and maintained during test implementation to help inform QA activities related to test selection, placement, training, usage and indicator measurement. Further practical considerations for QA of specific tests can be found at the Stop TB Partnership GLI website ( 12 ) , for which WHO serves as the Secretariat.","tokens_est":599,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Concurrent testing to improve case detection in children and in people (of all ages) living with HIV","content_type":"text","pages":"74-75","text":"3.4. Concurrent testing to improve case detection in children and in people (of all ages) living with HIV\n\nThe use of an mWRD as the initial test to diagnose TB greatly increases the sensitivity of the diagnostic process compared with the use of sputum smear microscopy ( 57 ) . However, certain subpopulations will not fully benefit from the high sensitivity of the molecular tests. For example, people living with HIV, especially those who are seriously ill, are known to have difficulties producing sputum; similarly, children, especially those aged below 5 years, often cannot easily produce sputum. In addition, if a person living with HIV or a young child can produce sputum, it will frequently have low or variable amounts of mycobacteria. These issues mean that it can be difficult to confirm TB disease bacteriologically; inclusion of alternate specimen types that can be collected in non-invasive ways could overcome some of these challenges, improve bacteriological confirmation of disease and speed time to diagnosis.\n\nTo assess whether testing of multiple specimen types with different tests – referred to by WHO as “concurrent testing” – enhances diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, WHO commissioned a systematic review in 2024, in which a GDG evaluated evidence for three risk groups: adult and adolescent people living with HIV, children aged below 10 years without HIV or with unknown HIV status, and children living with HIV. The tests for which data were available included LC- aNAAT (used on respiratory and stool samples), and the urine LF-LAM for HIV-positive individuals. The GDG assessed the following combinations:\n\n• adults and adolescents with HIV – LC- aNAAT on one respiratory sample and urine LF- LAM;\n\n• children – LC- aNAAT on one respiratory and one stool sample; and\n\n• children living with HIV – LC- aNAAT on one respiratory and one stool sample, and urine LF-LAM.\n\nFor all three combinations, the GDG concluded that concurrent testing improved testing accuracy compared with use of a single test, with moderate cost requirements and possible increases in testing workload. Based on the evidence, the GDG issued a strong recommendation to test concurrently with urine LF-LAM and LC- aNAAT on a respiratory sample for adults and adolescents living with HIV; and with LC- aNAAT on a respiratory and a stool sample for children without HIV or with unknown HIV status. However, for children living with HIV, the recommendation to test concurrently with urine LF-LAM and LC- aNAAT on a respiratory and a stool sample is conditional, owing to the low certainty of the evidence and the increased number of false positive results. The recommendation for use of LC- aNAATs on respiratory samples in the concurrent testing strategies applies to both Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra and Truenat MTB Plus and MTB-Rif Dx, whereas concurrent testing of stool samples is limited to the use of Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, given insufficient evidence on the use of Truenat tests with this sample type at the time of evidence assessment ( 5 ) .","tokens_est":760,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Concurrent testing to improve case detection in children and in people (of all ages) living with HIV (cont)\n\nThe recent update of the consolidated guidelines includes these new recommendations on concurrent testing for children and for people (of all ages) living with HIV (see Table 1.1 in the guidelines ( 5 ) ). The idea of concurrent testing is that all tests should be performed as soon as possible. People eligible for testing should be provided with information to help them understand this approach, including the need for more than one sample type and the need for any follow-up. Where possible, all sample types required for the concurrent testing strategy should be collected during the initial visit, and promptly tested or sent for analysis. Staffing and training needs should be assessed to ensure they are adequate for collection of quality samples, sample referral, and any changes or volume increase associated with onsite testing. Similarly, sites collecting urine should be equipped with private collection areas that have handwashing facilities, sterile collection containers, and clear procedures on the sanitary collection of midstream urine samples, to minimize contamination.\n\nA positive result on either test is a positive result overall; it is sufficient to confirm TB diagnosis and should trigger a decision to treat, to reduce delays. Although conducting multiple tests for anyone who is eligible can increase the sensitivity of the diagnostic process, the approach must be balanced against reduced specificity and programmatic implications (e.g. higher test costs and access to multiple sample types and tests). It is important to monitor and prevent patient loss to follow-up while awaiting a second diagnostic test or drug susceptibility test, or test results.\n\nLF-LAM is a POC test that can be performed onsite without delay and can provide results within 30 minutes, whereas results from LC- aNAATs require more time (≥90 minutes) for onsite testing (or longer when samples require referral for offsite testing). For example, concurrent testing in one setting involves an adult person living with HIV being tested onsite with LF-LAM while a sputum sample is transported to a site with LC- aNAAT . If the onsite LF-LAM yields a positive result, treatment can begin immediately and can later be adjusted based on the RIF result from the LC- aNAAT . If LF-LAM is unavailable, treatment decisions will rely on LC- aNAAT results alone; however, efforts should be made to ensure that LF-LAM testing is done.\n\nIf a test included in the concurrent testing strategy is not available at a site, this should not hinder the use of existing diagnostic tools. For example, if a site has LC- mNAAT (i.e. TB-LAMP) available onsite – a test not included in this recommendation – and also has LF-LAM, both tests should be conducted as soon as possible. A positive result from either test warrants treatment initiation. An additional sample should be referred for testing with LC- aNAAT , to determine the individual’s RIF resistance status; this should also be done in cases where both tests are negative.\n\nFor children who are HIV-negative or whose HIV status is unknown, one stool sample and one respiratory sample should be tested on LC- aNAAT according to the concurrent testing strategy. Stool can be collected at peripheral sites and, if there is also capacity to collect respiratory samples from children, the samples can be tested with LC- aNAAT concurrently. If testing capacity is not available onsite, samples should be transported to a site with LC- aNAAT capacity. For children living with HIV, a urine sample should be collected in addition to the respiratory and stool samples. Testing with LF-LAM should be conducted onsite if the test is available, regardless of whether LC- aNAAT is available, and a positive result should trigger a treatment decision while awaiting LC- aNAAT results.","tokens_est":981,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

If a stool sample is available and the LC- aNAAT result is negative, additional respiratory sampling should be undertaken (e.g. induced sputum, nasopharyngeal or gastric aspirate) for LC- aNAAT testing at a higher level facility, to maximize opportunities for bacteriological confirmation of disease and determine RIF resistance status. If a stool sample is available and the result is positive, and RIF resistance results are available, treatment should be initiated; in such cases, collection of a respiratory sample is not necessary.\n\nOwing to the limited sensitivity of the available diagnostic assays in children, clinical diagnosis continues to play a critical role in the diagnosis of TB. The aim of the concurrent testing strategy in this population is to increase testing sensitivity, but diagnosis should not be delayed because of the unavailability of a sample type or test, or the availability of negative test results alone. Delaying diagnosis leads to higher rates of loss to follow-up and additional burdens on clients. Therefore, laboratory-based investigations in children should not happen in isolation but rather should be embedded as part of the clinical evaluation process. Clinical diagnoses are usually based on suggestive signs and symptoms and a history of TB contact, with or without chest radiography.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of testing for TB infection?\n\nTesting for TB infection will be beneficial for both individuals and programmes if it identifies people who will benefit most from TPT. For programmes , investments in the capacity to test for TB infection will be justified if this results in greater efficacy and efficiency in the use of resources to provide TPT, increased acceptance and enhanced coverage. Investments are needed to cover not only the cost of drugs but also the human resources for medical evaluation, TPT initiation and follow-up. Testing for TB infection will also reduce unnecessary expenditure on medication or adverse events experienced by those receiving unnecessary treatment. Hence, testing for TB infection before TPT is a valuable way to increase the TPT benefit–risk ratio.\n\nThe use of TPT reduces the risk of developing TB disease among people living with HIV, particularly in those who are TST positive. The updated systematic review undertaken during the development of the WHO guidelines on programmatic management of TPT in 2018 clearly demonstrated the benefits of systematic testing and treatment of TB infection among people living with HIV in terms of prevalence of TB infection, risk of progression to TB disease and incidence of TB disease when compared with the general population.\n\nHousehold contacts were found to be at a substantially higher risk for progression to TB disease than the general population. The highest risk progression to active disease was among contacts who were aged below 5 years; hence, a strong recommendation to start TPT – irrespective of the availability of testing for TB infection – was issued. In addition, TPT was conditionally recommended for household contacts in other age groups, following assessment of harms versus benefits. Among household contacts aged above 5 years, testing for TB infection before TPT initiation may be desirable, although treatment was considered justifiable even without testing ( 59 ) .\n\nAmong other risk groups, the evidence of benefits from systematic testing for TB infection and TPT varied. The benefits clearly exceeded the risks among people starting anti-TNF treatment, receiving dialysis, preparing for an organ or haematological transplant, or having silicosis. In other risk groups, the risk versus benefit was less clear. Therefore, prioritization of target groups for systematic testing and TPT based on individual risk and the local and national context was acceptable to people with TB infection and to key stakeholders, including clinicians, nurses and programme managers.\n\nIn summary, TPT will provide the greatest individual health benefits if given to people with clinical or epidemiological characteristics that increase the risk of TB disease and who also test positive for TB infection (not including contacts of TB patients who are aged <5 years and people living with HIV, for whom testing is not a prerequisite for TPT).\n\nThe most important disadvantage of testing for TB infection is the potential for significant delays between initial identification of someone at risk of developing TB disease and the initiation of TPT. In contacts, particularly young children ( 59 ) and people living with HIV, TB disease can develop rapidly after exposure and TB infection.

Hence, prompt initiation of TPT is crucial to prevent TB disease. Testing for TB infection may contribute to substantial delays, owing either to a lack of trained personnel to administer the test or read the skin test result, or to delays in laboratory processing and communication of IGRA test results. The results of IGRA testing should be available within 24–36 hours (although there may be additional delays due to sample transport and batch testing) and within 72 hours for TST or TBST; thus, testing for TB infection should not delay the initiation of TPT by more than 3 days after the initial identification.\n\nThe second potential challenge with testing is the greater burden on patients, including discomfort, fear of injections or blood collection, and the need for more visits before starting TPT (with associated potential patient costs, time, delays and resulting losses from the cascade of care). However, effective organization of health services can minimize cascade of care losses related to testing ( 42 , 60 ) , both in high-income countries and in LMIC.\n\nFalse negative and indeterminate TB infection tests are a third potential challenge ( 61 ) . Such test outcomes are more frequent among immunocompromised individuals. However, the high relative risks of developing TB disease in people with positive TB infection tests compared with those with negative tests suggests that false negative results are not major determinants of outcomes that are important to patients. Additionally, some people at risk (e.g. older contacts) may test negative but become infected later, or show infection shortly after the test; in such cases, not giving TPT would be a missed opportunity to protect people.","tokens_est":472,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Multidisease testing considerations\n\nHealth needs are diverse, and programmes are expected to provide a range of diagnostics to assist health workers in managing patients as effectively and efficiently as possible. The diagnosis of TB often begins with assessing symptoms; this is not specific to TB, given that cough and fever overlap with COVID-19 and other respiratory infections. Additionally, people with TB may also have HIV, and services for both diseases are usually provided at the same levels of care. The relative diagnostic volumes are also quite heterogeneous, and they can be low for a specific disease or on a specific day at peripheral health centres . Multidisease testing can maximize the use of limited testing instruments and other resources; an information note describing considerations for multidisease testing is available ( 59 ) .\n\nAll currently recommended molecular diagnostics for the initial diagnosis of TB have a SARS-CoV-2 test available on the same instrument as the TB test, although some may not have received regulatory approval for such use. Several platforms are also widely used in diagnosing and managing TB in people living with HIV, whereas others are used for diagnosis of other viral pathogens (e.g. hepatitis C virus and human papillomavirus) or antimicrobial resistance\n\ndetection among bacterial pathogens. Additionally, one of the recommended IGRAs also runs on a platform that allows testing a range of other conditions; NGS platforms can also be used to sequence any nucleic acids present in a sample. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic led to NGS capacity being established in many countries, including LMIC, for surveillance. Such capacity and expertise may be available and could be used to facilitate the rapid uptake of targeted NGS-based DST for TB. If multidisease testing on an instrument is planned, then it may be best to employ platforms that use random access approaches (e.g. GeneXpert or Truenat ) or allow different types of tests to be performed in the same batch or at the same time (e.g. BD MAX or targeted NGS) so that patient results are not delayed.","tokens_est":532,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Peripheral level\n\nAt the peripheral level (Level I), laboratories offer a range of basic diagnostic tests, with the focus being on providing initial testing to rapidly detect TB (and RIF resistance):\n\n• The LF-LAM is the only instrument-free, POC, lateral flow TB test that delivers results within 25–30 minutes and is suitable for use in the clinic. Thus, antiretroviral therapy initiation sites or similar care centres for people living with HIV would be examples of appropriate placement sites. The test is recommended for use concurrently with an LC- aNAAT among adults, adolescents and children living with HIV. Therefore, the collection of sputum and stool must also be performed, and the samples sent for testing with an LC- aNAAT .\n\n• LC- aNAATs are suitable for decentralized laboratory placement, offering the advantage of sensitive TB detection with simultaneous or reflex-based drug-resistance testing at the same site. Prior or existing smear microscopy sites are suitable for LC- aNAAT placement because the population served is the same and the infrastructure requirements are similar.\n\n– Battery operated LC- aNAATs (e.g. Truenat assays) may be useful at sites where the power supply is unstable ( 61 ) .\n\n– LC- aNAATs for follow-on testing of samples from patients confirmed as having TB and RIF resistance may also be done onsite to speed up the availability of resistance results for INH, FQ, ETO and AMK without sample referral. However, the current within-class test, Xpert MTB/XDR, requires a different type of GeneXpert module (10-colour) than the Xpert Ultra test (6-colour). Given that the number of tests needed over a certain period will be much lower than the number for initial TB diagnosis, programmes can decide to replace one or more 6-colour module (s) with one or more 10-colour module(s) in existing GeneXpert instruments, to avoid replacing fully functional instruments. Furthermore, because the test has important value in providing rapid results for the management of MDR/RR-TB, sites where drug resistance is more prevalent or treatment is delivered may be prioritized for Xpert MTB/XDR testing.\n\n• The LC- mNAAT (TB-LAMP) is also suitable for placement at the peripheral laboratory level. This class is less automated and has more testing steps than LC- aNAATs , but is also cheaper than LC- aNAATs and provides results where power supplies may vary or can be boosted with solar panels ( 62 ) . However, because it does not detect RIF resistance, an alternative test or a sample referral mechanism should be considered in populations who are at high risk of MDR-TB and in settings with moderate-to-high or unknown pretest probability of DR-TB, particularly where follow-on testing for RIF resistance is not accessible or available.\n\n• TB infection skin tests can be used in peripheral settings owing to their simple procedures. Taking the incubation period and the need for a follow-up visit into consideration, it is preferable to provide access to the test as close to the target population as possible. It is important to ensure that storage possibilities (2–8 °C) are available for the TST or TBST, and that staff are adequately trained in administering the test and reading the results.","tokens_est":809,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Combining an efficient specimen referral system with centralized testing can be a cost-effective approach where the burden is low; it can also be more sustainable where there are shortages of skilled staff to capacitate and maintain a large, quality-assured peripheral-level network:\n\n• The new MC- aNAATs are suitable at this level.

Structure of network and testing packages\n\nThe structure of the network and the testing packages available at each level should be tailored to meet the needs of the community and the local epidemiology of TB. When considering placement of a diagnostic test, targets to be considered should be based on demand rather than population, and should include:\n\n• the volume of testing at a laboratory, which is likely to vary between dense urban settings and sparse rural communities;\n\n• a strategy for providing optimal access to quality testing, either by increasing the number of sites providing a test or by transporting specimens to high-volume testing centres through an efficient specimen referral system – the strategy of choice will be determined by geography, infrastructure for transporting of specimens and result reporting, and epidemiological situation; and\n\n• interlinking of the different levels; for example, the results of an initial test (e.g. RIF resistance detected) may trigger a follow-on test (e.g. testing for FQ resistance), which may not be available at the same level of the health system.\n\nAlthough the levels described are useful conceptually, in practice they may overlap considerably, and careful logistical planning by mapping the current network of health facilities, population densities, the testing burden across the different facilities, transport infrastructure and the available laboratory network will aid placement (e.g. primary TB testing of people presumed to have TB will be relevant across all health facilities where individuals are screened for TB, whereas people with RR-TB may be managed at selected sites, and placement of testing for FQ and BDQ resistance may only be needed in selected laboratories that serve those sites).\n\nSeveral considerations should guide the placement of a new diagnostic test within the existing laboratory network structure, including:\n\n• anticipated workload, in terms of:\n\n– projected testing volumes;\n\n– availability of trained staff;\n\n• possibility of integration with testing, specimen referral and reporting systems for other diseases; and\n\n• resources available, such as:\n\n– infrastructural requirements (laboratory and storage space, power supply and temperature control );\n\n– biosafety requirements;\n\n– specimen types and collection procedures;\n\n– requirement for rapid diagnosis in people who are severely ill;\n\n– minimum number of tests needed to maintain expertise and optimal use of instruments;\n\n– current and planned testing algorithms;\n\n– links to other laboratories for further testing;\n\n– specimen referral and result reporting systems; and\n\nWell-designed specimen referral systems underpin a strong diagnostics network. Such systems can help to :\n\n• optimize access to services, and improve promptness of testing, use of instruments, biosafety and biosecurity, maintenance of proficiency and QA;\n\n• facilitate linkages to care;\n\n• provide solutions adapted to the local geography and epidemiology; and\n\n• make it possible to integrate sample transportation with testing for other diseases, thus providing broader testing services in underserved settings.\n\nThe GLI guide to TB specimen referral systems and integrated networks ( 63 ) and the GLI specimen referral toolkit ( 64 ) are useful sources of information for designing, implementing and monitoring systems for referring specimens and reporting results.","tokens_est":851,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Regulatory approval is generally provided for a specific test produced by a specific manufacturer, not for the class of the test.

Validation studies are an essential part of the WHO review process and the development of recommendations for the use of a new test. Once large-scale validation studies have been published and a test’s target performance characteristics have been established, countries that are implementing the method do not need to repeat such large-scale studies. Repeat validation should only be conducted if registration or importation regulations require it, because the efforts may use valuable limited testing resources and delay the implementation of the test.\n\nInstead, implementing laboratories should conduct small-scale verification studies to demonstrate that they can achieve the same performance characteristics that were obtained\n\nduring the validation studies when using the test as described in those validation studies, and establish that the method is suitable for its intended use in the population being tested.

The most suitable instrument for a country will depend on the intended use of, and demand for, the diagnostic test. It is important to choose an instrument that is widely available and has good supply distribution and support from the manufacturer. In addition to the testing instrument, some tests will require the use of specialized ancillary instruments.\n\nTo bring cost efficiency to testing services, a priority should be to consider the integration of TB testing with existing platforms in locations where integrated testing is feasible ( 59 ) . In settings where TB diagnostic services are standalone and there is a high workload for TB testing, dedicated instruments may be preferred.\n\nWhichever instrument is selected, expert set-up will generally be required, with the manufacturer’s engineers or authorized service providers performing the installation. Some of the MC- aNAATs may require infrastructure to be modified to accommodate the instruments. Potential set-up complexities include power supply and backup options, electrical and network connections, environmental conditions for the laboratory (e.g. maximum temperature), biosafety and ventilation requirements, computing hardware and software, a maintenance plan (e.g. weekly, monthly or pre-run checks), equipment warranty and necessary training.\n\nGuidance for selecting which mWRD to implement has been published in the Manual for selection of molecular WHO-recommended rapid diagnostic tests for detection of tuberculosis and drug-resistant tuberculosis ( 15 ) . Guidance on selecting NGS equipment is available elsewhere ( 33 ).\n\nFor TB infection skin tests, a standalone or medical-grade refrigerator for storing consumables (tuberculin or TB antigens), vaccines and medications must be available, as must backup generators or power supply system.

The frequency of calibration and its intervals vary for each instrument. To decide on the frequency of calibration, the manufacturer’s recommendations should be followed at a minimum. However, where it is suspected that the level of accuracy of the equipment is declining, those responsible should be able to discern the problem and take the initiative to perform calibration.\n\nLaboratory equipment calibration requires an association between measurements of a scale or accuracy that have been made or set with the equipment to be tested, and similar measurements that have been made with the standard (i.e. equipment with known or assigned accuracy). Standards vary among countries, depending on the type of industry. Manufacturers designate their measurement criterion; they also recommend the frequency and level of calibration, depending on how often the device is used and the specific application.\n\nMany tests rely on precision instruments that require regular preventive maintenance, and ad hoc servicing and maintenance. The end-user should perform regular preventive maintenance to ensure good performance of the instrument. Suppliers or authorized service providers should perform on-request maintenance, as necessary. To ensure continued functioning of the instruments, countries should take advantage of all-inclusive and transparent maintenance contracts; these contracts should have clear service and maintenance terms and associated costs.","tokens_est":473,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Laboratory managers should routinely monitor reagent quality and shelf life to ensure that high-quality test results are generated. Also, the laboratory must establish SOPs for handling the reagents and chemicals used, to\n\nensure both quality and safety. For example, the shelf life of NGS reagents is normally short; hence, robust planning is required to avoid kits expiring, with resulting high costs for testing. For tuberculin, once the vial has been opened, the material should be used within 30 days; thus, the date of opening should be clearly written on the label of the vial. The vial should be stored immediately at the end of the working day, at the prescribed temperature. Any tuberculin remaining after 30 days must be discarded. The duration varies for TBST; hence, manufacturer specifications should be followed.\n\nNew-lot testing, also known as lot-to-lot verification, should be performed on new batches of reagents or test kits. Such testing usually involves testing a sample of the new materials and comparing the results to an existing lot of materials with known performance. Where possible, new-lot testing of commercially available test kits should be performed at the central (e.g. NTRL) or regional level, thereby ensuring that kits with test failures are not distributed.

Information must also be shared with clinical staff at all referral sites through staff training opportunities and through the use of standardized educational materials developed by the NTP . Enhanced clinical trainings should be considered when new tests or testing strategies differ from existing assays in terms of performance or rates of discordant results (e.g. LF-LAM and targeted NGS testing versus LC- aNAAT and phenotypic DST assays).\n\nThe rate of ordering of the new test must be monitored, to ensure that the test is being used by the clinical staff at all sites offering the test. Clinical staff at sites with an unexpectedly low or high testing rate may need additional training and sensitization.","tokens_est":351,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

The implementation plan should consider software and hardware requirements, to take advantage of digital data. “Diagnostic connectivity” refers to the ability to connect diagnostic test devices that produce results in a digital format, in such a way as to transmit data reliably to a variety of users ( 68 ) . Key features of the systems are the ability to monitor performance remotely, conduct QA and manage inventory. With remote monitoring, designated individuals can use any internet-enabled computer to access the software, providing an overview of the facilities, devices and commodities in the network. Software can track consumption and inventory to avoid stock-outs and expiring supplies. It can also identify commodity lots or specific instruments with poor performance or abnormal error rates for QA purposes, and provide a pre-emptive service to avoid instrument failure. This approach is a highly cost-effective way to ensure that a diagnostic device network functions properly; it is also useful for reporting and connecting with treatment sites.\n\nData, results and information updates can also be transmitted automatically to:\n\n• clinicians and patients, allowing for faster patient follow- up;\n\n• laboratory information management systems or electronic registers, reducing staff time and the chance of transcription errors, and greatly facilitating monitoring and evaluation processes; and\n\n• the NTP , assisting with surveillance of disease trends or resistance patterns and rates, and enhancing the capacity of the NTP to generate the data needed for performance indicators of the End TB Strategy.","tokens_est":443,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Onsite supervision should be prioritized at poorly performing sites identified through proficiency testing, monthly monitoring of performance indicators or site assessments. Failure to enrol in a comprehensive EQA programme is a missed opportunity to identify and correct problems that affect the quality of testing. Where EQA programmes are available, their use should be considered during test selection, planning and budgeting processes before tests are introduced.\n\nThe GLI has developed an EQA dashboard that lists available EQA panel and programme providers ( 56 ) . The products are not endorsed by GLI; however, the dashboard is a resource where countries can find suitable panels or programmes ( 56 ) .\n\nProficiency testing\n\nFor many laboratory tests, the EQA programme includes proficiency testing to determine the quality of the results generated at the testing site. Proficiency testing compares testing site results with a reference result to determine comparability. The purpose of such testing is to identify sites with serious testing deficiencies, target support to the most poorly performing sites and evaluate the proficiency of users following training.\n\nRe-checking of samples\n\nComparisons between laboratories can also be used as an external assessment of quality. This usually involves the retesting of samples at a higher level laboratory. Many TB laboratories are familiar with this approach because blinded re-checking is a routine method of EQA for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear microscopy.\n\nOnsite supervisory visits\n\nOnsite supervisory visits are especially critical during the early stages of implementing a new test because they provide motivation and support to staff. Supervisory visits are opportunities to provide refresher training, mentoring, troubleshooting advice and technical updates. Onsite assessments should be documented using standardized checklists, to ensure consistency and completeness of information, enable monitoring of trends, and allow follow-up on recommendations and corrective actions. An onsite supervisory programme requires substantial planning and resources (both financial and human).\n\nAlthough not performed in laboratories, skin tests for TB infection need continuous internal QC and EQA. In many countries, certification of such tests is required after complex training and control, but a follow-up quality assessment is not in place.

In addition to the general laboratory quality indicators recommended in the 2022 update to the practical manual on TB laboratory strengthening ( 65 ) , quality indicators specific to the new diagnostic test should be adapted from international guidelines or developed from scratch. Quality indicators for NGS-based DST have been developed and are described in the WHO implementation manual ( 33 ) . The indicators should be collected using a standardized format and analysed on a monthly or quarterly basis, disaggregated according to test.\n\nProgrammes should establish a baseline for all indicators. Targets should be set for all indicators monitored, and any unexplained change in quality indicators (e.g. an increase in error rates or a change in MTBC positivity) should be documented and investigated. A standard set of quality indicators should be used for all sites conducting a particular test, to allow for comparison between sites.\n\nThe continuous quality improvement process is a cyclical, continuous, data-driven approach to improving the quality of diagnostic testing. The process relies on a cycle of monitoring quality indicators, planning interventions to correct or improve performance, and implementing the interventions. Quality indicators should be reviewed by the laboratory manager and must always be linked to corrective actions if any unexpected results or trends are observed. Critical\n\nto the process is documentation of corrective actions, and subsequent improvement and normalization of laboratory indicators following the corrective actions.","tokens_est":443,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Countries should determine whether an update of the examination forms is needed, considering the cost and time required for such a revision. If a system is not already in place, countries should establish a numbering system to identify repeat samples from the same person, to monitor the proportion and performance of repeat tests.\n\nGiven that patient data (e.g. on treatment status) are critical for the correct interpretation of test results, programmes should ensure that the test request form captures such information. In many countries, request forms already contain fields for such data; however, sometimes data may either not be entered in some of these fields or be entered inconsistently. Refresher training for clinical and laboratory staff should be conducted, to ensure that forms are filled out correctly and completed properly.\n\nThe forms used for reporting test results must balance the need to convey the test information while also conveying the information that is essential to allow a clinician to interpret the results and act promptly on them. An easy-to-read format is important because there is likely to be a wide range of expertise among the clinicians interpreting test results. Also, to avoid confusion, results should only be reported for medicines that are being used in-country and in alignment with national guidelines. For example, WHO recommends against the use of AMK, except for people with XDR-TB; hence, AMK results should only be reported when relevant for clinical decisions.\n\nAn easy-to-read format is particularly important for targeted NGS solutions because they generate a large amount of data. At a minimum, the reporting form should capture the unique patient identifier; also, for each drug analysed , the report form and database should include information on the genes analysed , any mutations detected, and the corresponding confidence grading and resistance profile for each drug. It is recommended that reporting of results should depend on quality criteria (e.g. at least 20 successful reads per base across the gene of interest) being met ( 72 ) .\n\nA global consortium previously led a consensus process to standardize language for reporting of NGS-based DST results and generate a generic reporting form for MTBC based on NGS DST results ( 73 ) . The consensus forms are intended to be used to report NGS-based DST results to clinicians for use in patient-care decisions, but they may also be useful guides for developing forms for reporting information for a DR-TB surveillance system.\n\nReporting results of tests for TB infection, medical evaluation, CXR and other testing should also be streamlined, and ideally it should be digitized to facilitate rapid referral and analysis. The Prevent TB mobile application and digital platform is expected to facilitate systematic recording and reporting, as well as monitoring of data across the cascade of care for TB infection ( 74 ) .

Model algorithms\n\nEffective and efficient TB diagnostic algorithms are key components of a diagnostic cascade that is designed to ensure that people with TB disease or TB infection are diagnosed accurately and rapidly, and promptly placed on appropriate therapy. In turn, that therapy should improve patient outcomes, reduce transmission and avoid development of drug resistance. This section presents a set of four model algorithms that incorporate the goals of the End TB Strategy and the most recent WHO recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of TB, DR-TB and TB infection. The model algorithms should be adapted to the local situation.\n\nWhen adapting a diagnostic algorithm to local settings, it is important to consider the characteristics of the population being served. The four algorithms are as follows:\n\n• Algorithm 1 is the general algorithm that relies on WRDs, such as low- or moderate-complexity NAATs, as the initial diagnostic tests and is appropriate for all settings, although the choice of which mWRD to use may differ in a setting with a high prevalence of MDR/ RR-TB (e.g. a test that detects MTBC and RIF with or without INH resistance may be needed), HIV (e.g. a more sensitive test may be needed) or Hr -TB (e.g. a test that detects MTBC, RIF and INH resistance simultaneously will be needed). The algorithm considers the new recommendations on concurrent testing (including use of LF-LAM) for specified risk groups as the first step before results interpretation and management.\n\n• Algorithm 2 and Algorithm 3 are for follow-up testing, after TB is diagnosed, to detect additional drug resistance:\n\n– Algorithms 2a and 2b are used when the purpose is to detect resistance to second-line drugs in people with RR-TB; the choice depends on the availability of targeted NGS.\n\n– Algorithm 3 is used when the purpose is to detect resistance in individuals with RIF-susceptible TB who are at risk of having DR-TB and those with Hr -TB. Molecular testing is preferred, but any existing WRD may be used. Targeted NGS is a valuable addition for Algorithm 2 and 3 because these tests can detect mutations associated with resistance to many anti-TB medicines; also, these molecular tests are useful for people at high risk of having DR-TB (e.g. people in whom therapy is failing).\n\n• Algorithm 4 is the model algorithm for diagnosing TB infection performed based on the recommendations in the WHO consolidated guidelines for tuberculosis: module 2: screening ( 81 ) . Testing for TB infection should only be conducted after ruling out TB disease.\n\nAlgorithms 2 and 3 are appropriate for all settings; however, the resource requirements for follow-up testing may differ widely between settings with a high or low burden of DR-TB.\n\nEach algorithm is accompanied by explanatory notes and a decision pathway that provides a detailed description of considerations for how test results may be used to guide patient care.\n\nIn general, the algorithms are not necessarily test-specific; rather, they present classes of tests that share expected result categories (e.g. “TB detected”) and their follow-up actions.","tokens_est":782,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

WHO has released updated recommendations on TB screening, and readers are encouraged to consult the latest guidance ( 54 , 81 ) . People presumed to have TB may not always present with symptoms that match the latest screening recommendations, but they still have an increased probability of TB disease that requires diagnostic testing. The modalities for screening, beyond the four-symptom screen, now include CXR, an mWRD used as a screening tool or C-reactive protein in people living with HIV. The addition of mWRD for screening of selected at-risk populations and settings goes beyond its primary use as an initial diagnostic tool; the different uses should not be confused and are further described elsewhere ( 54 ) . However, priority should be given to ensuring universal access to mWRDs as a diagnostic test for TB and DR-TB before extending its use to screening. Furthermore, the use of mWRDs as a screening test should be considered carefully because it would have large financial and operational implications (e.g. are there enough tests and testing capacity to use mWRDs for screening, in addition to what is needed to conduct all testing for the initial diagnosis and detection of RIF resistance). The methods for screening for TB are described in detail in the latest operational handbook on screening ( 54 ) . It is important to consider prevalence and pretest probability when choosing a screening strategy, especially in scenarios where mWRDs are used in a screening context rather than for diagnostic testing.","tokens_est":429,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

The cascade of the four model algorithms\n\nAlthough the algorithms are presented separately, they are interlinked and cascade from one to another. This is illustrated in the overview in Fig. 6.1 , which describes how the different algorithms cascade from the starting point of a person being evaluated for TB. If the person screens positive, or is presumed to have TB, samples are collected for diagnostic and RIF-resistance testing according to Algorithm 1. The number and type of recommended samples and tests varies according to the person’s age and HIV status (as shown in Fig. 6.1: I-IV ). The result of the initial test or tests will guide further actions ( Fig. 6.1 ).\n\nFor people who test positive for TB and in whom RIF resistance is detected, further work-up is needed. Algorithms 2a and 2b provide guidance on the additional testing required to detect resistance to FQs and other second-line drugs. People with TB that is susceptible to RIF may require further testing for INH resistance and second-line drugs; Algorithm 3 provides guidance on suitable tests.\n\nPeople who screen negative for TB or in whom TB disease has been ruled out through testing should be clinically evaluated. Clinical evaluation is especially important for children, who experience lower rates of bacteriological confirmation of TB owing to low and variable amounts of mycobacteria in their samples. Further practical guidance on the clinical management of childhood TB and example treatment decision algorithms can be found in the WHO operational handbook on tuberculosis: module 5: management of TB in children and adolescents ( 58 ) .\n\nPeople in whom TB is excluded are then assessed for the need for TPT or testing for TB infection (or both) ( Fig. 6.1: V ).

Algorithm 1 – WRDs as initial diagnostic tests for TB\n\nAlgorithm 1 is the starting point for the diagnostic pathway, and in this context the recommended classes of WRDs include both molecular tests (LC- mNAAT , LC- aNAAT and MC- aNAAT ) and a biomarker-based test (LF-LAM) ( Fig. 6.2 ). Member States can choose the mWRD that best fits their circumstances, with the ultimate objective being to serve patient needs and ensure universal access to diagnostic and RIF-resistance testing. The mWRD classes provide different types of results:\n\n• TB diagnosis only, using an LC- mNAAT ;\n\n• TB diagnosis and detection of RIF resistance (simultaneously or as a two-step process) using an LC- aNAAT ; or\n\n• TB diagnosis and detection of RIF and INH resistance (simultaneously or as a two-step process) using an MC- aNAAT .\n\nWhere an LC- mNAAT is used, follow-on testing for RIF resistance may be needed.\n\nLF-LAM provides a result for TB diagnosis only (without RIF resistance). Recommendations for the urine LF-LAM have been expanded to apply to all individuals infected with HIV, regardless of setting and CD4 count; also, the test has been integrated with LC- aNAATs in the recently recommended concurrent testing strategy for adults, adolescents and children living with HIV. The recommendations on concurrent testing do not include the use of LC- mNAATs or MC- aNAATs .\n\nThe test options for Algorithm 1 vary in complexity. LF-LAM is the only POC test for the initial detection of TB that does not require special skills for testing or laboratory infrastructure. The LC- aNAATs require basic pipetting skills and are easy to decentralize to basic laboratories; however, they have limited throughput with the commonly used instruments. In contrast, some MC- aNAATs require more hands-on time and have large infrastructure requirements; most of them provide high throughput and are best suited to established laboratories with reliable sample referral networks. In practice, test needs and associated choices are likely to vary, depending on the setting within a country or province. Consideration should be given towards hybrid models that use a combination of tests from different manufacturers; this has the added advantage of providing a safety mechanism in the event of an expected problem with a supplier.\n\nIt is feasible to implement Algorithm 1 when the mWRD testing can be conducted onsite or can be accessed through a reliable referral system with short turnaround times.","tokens_est":620,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

They include adults and children with signs or symptoms suggestive of TB, with a CXR showing abnormalities suggestive of TB, a positive mWRD used as a screening tool or positive C-reactive protein test (>5 mg/L) in PLHIV. A person with a positive mWRD used as a screening tool and a low pretest probability should be clinically assessed and, if deemed to be a person presumed to have TB, should have a repeat mWRD performed and follow Algorithm 1. If the pretest probability is high and the clinical picture is consistent with TB disease, then this test could be considered diagnostic and the person should be managed based on the result of the test and, if relevant, should continue on to Algorithm 2 or 3. This algorithm may also be followed for the diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB using CSF, lymph node and other tissue specimens. However, mWRDs that are recommended for use in the diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB investigations are currently limited to Xpert Ultra.\nb Programmes may consider collecting two specimens upfront. The first specimen should be promptly tested using the mWRD . The second specimen may be used for the additional testing described in this algorithm. For individuals being evaluated for pulmonary TB, sputum is the preferred specimen. Tissue biopsy samples are difficult or impossible to obtain repeatedly; therefore, they should be tested with as many methods as possible (e.g. mWRD , culture, DST or histology).\nc mWRD includes LC- aNAAT , LC- mNAAT and MC- aNAAT for the general population.\nd The concurrent testing strategy was only assessed for LC- aNAAT in combination with LF-LAM owing to lack of evidence for LC- mNAAT and MC- aNAAT . A laboratory equipped only with LC- mNAAT or MC- aNAAT can also use these tools to diagnosis both of PLHIV and children because both classes are recommended for initial diagnosis of TB of these groups. Additional testing may be required to detect RIF resistance if LC- mNAAT was used. This strategy is not covered by the concurrent testing recommendations but is a way to increase sensitivity in the diagnostic cascade without unnecessary delays. An initial positive result on any of these tests, LC- mNAAT , MC- aNAAT or LF- LAM should lead to treatment initiation.\ne Only the result from the single mWRD is available for this group.\nf LF-LAM should not be used on people who are HIV- negative.\ng “MTBC detected (if Ultra, not trace results)” includes MTBC detected as high, medium, low or very low. These categories apply to the Xpert Ultra tests. Results of the Truenat MTB and MTB Plus tests, MC- aNAAT and the TB LAMP test also fall into the category of “MTBC detected (if Ultra, not trace results)”. The MC- aNAAT provides additional resistance detection for INH and leads to additional considerations in pathway B.\nh Determination of RIF resistance occurs simultaneously in the Xpert Ultra test and the MC- aNAAT . A reflex test is needed to determine RIF resistance for Truenat testing, using the same DNA isolated for the Truenat MTB test. The TB-LAMP test requires a fresh specimen to be collected and a molecular or phenotypic DST to be conducted. In the case of MC- aNAAT , INH resistance detection also occurs simultaneously with RIF detection.\ni The interpretation and follow-up testing for MTBC detected and RIF indeterminate or unknown for the Xpert Ultra test differs from the interpretation of results for other mWRDs . MTBC detected with RIF indeterminate results obtained with the Xpert Ultra test (especially those with high and medium semiquantitative results) may be due to large deletions or multiple mutations that confer RIF resistance. Analysis of the Xpert Ultra melt curves can detect such resistance-conferring mutations. In some cases, culture and DST, sequencing or alternative mWRD will be needed to confirm or exclude RIF resistance. Indeterminate results for the other mWRDs are usually related to very low numbers of bacilli in the sample. When using an mWRD without detection of RIF resistance (e.g. TB-LAMP), further testing for RIF resistance is required preferably using an mWRD able to detect resistance.\nj “ MTBC detected trace” applies only to the Xpert Ultra test.\nk Further investigations for TB may include CXR, additional clinical assessments, repeat mWRD testing, culture or clinical response following treatment with broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents.\nl People should be initiated on a first-line regimen according to national guidelines, unless the person is at very high risk of having MDR-TB. Such people should be further investigated and initiated on an MDR-TB regimen if pertinent. In situations where INH results are available (e.g. MC- aNAAT ) and INH resistance has not been detected, the probability of having MDR-TB would be lower.\nm A sample may be sent for molecular or phenotypic DST if there is a high prevalence of INH or other drug resistance and RIF susceptible (i.e. INH monoresistance or polyresistance) in this setting. Where a result for INH resistance is “not detected” (e.g. MC- aNAAT ), and the pretest probability for Hr -TB is high, phenotypic DST for INH should be performed.\nn People at high risk for MDR-TB include people who were treated previously, including those who had been lost to follow-up, relapsed or experienced treatment failure; non-converters (smear positive at end of intensive phase); MDR-TB contacts; and any other groups at risk for MDR-TB identified in the country.\no The mWRD with RIF testing should be performed at the same testing site with a fresh specimen, and the result of the second test should be interpreted as shown in this algorithm. The RIF result from the second test is the result that should be used for clinical decisions.\np PLHIV include those who are HIV-positive or whose HIV status is unknown, but who present with strong clinical evidence of HIV infection, reside in settings where there is a high prevalence of HIV or are members of a group at risk for HIV. For all those with unknown HIV status, HIV testing should be performed according to national guidelines.\nq People should be promptly initiated on an MDR-TB regimen in accordance with national guidelines. Algorithm 2 should be followed for additional testing for any person with RR-TB.\nr Phenotypic (culture and DST) and molecular (e.g. alternate mWRDs , LPAs and targeted NGS) methods are available for evaluating drug resistance. Rapid molecular methods are preferred.\ns In people with a prior history of TB within the past 5 years or whose TB treatment was completed less than 5 years ago, Xpert Ultra trace results (and occasionally “MTBC detected low or very low”) may be false positive, not because of active TB but because of the presence of non-viable bacilli. Clinical decisions must be made based on all available information and clinical judgement.\nt People diagnosed using an MC- aNAAT and whose result is RIF resistance not detected, and INH resistance detected should be treated for Hr -TB with REZ and levofloxacin. For practical purposes, HREZ fixed-dose combination tablets may be used instead of REZ.

WHO also recommends the concurrent use of urine LF-LAM and an LC- aNAAT to diagnose TB among adults, adolescents and children living with HIV (see Section 3.4 ). Details on the different tests included in the different classes are given in Section 2 . The target populations include:\n\n• newly presenting individuals with symptoms of TB (cough of any duration, fever, haemoptysis , night sweats and weight loss );\n\n• individuals who have screened positive for TB by an alternative method (e.g. CXR or C-reactive protein) and require confirmation; and\n\n• individuals who are on treatment or have been previously treated, or people being evaluated for possible RR-TB or Hr -TB (e.g. non-converters at the end of the intensive phase of treatment despite treatment adherence) or for a new or continuing episode of TB (e.g. relapse cases or people treated previously, including those who had been lost to follow-up).\n\nTB programmes should transition from using microscopy as the initial diagnostic test to using mWRDs . The mWRDs show a higher sensitivity for the diagnosis of TB; also, they can simultaneously detect resistance to RIF and, in cases of MC- aNAAT use, resistance to INH.\n\nFor monitoring treatment, mWRDs are not recommended, because the tests do not discriminate between live and dead bacilli and thus may generate false positive results. Instead, microscopy and culture should be used for monitoring treatment, in accordance with national guidelines and WHO recommendations. More information on the need to develop more rapid and sensitive tools for TB treatment monitoring can be found in the 2023 WHO target product profiles for tests for tuberculosis treatment monitoring and optimization ( 82 ) .\n\nAlgorithm 1 describes the collection of one or more quality initial specimens to be used for mWRD testing and the collection of additional specimens as needed (information on which specimens can be used with which WRD is given in Section 2 above and in individual WHO policy recommendations):\n\n• for adults and adolescents, specimens that may be used are induced or expectorated sputum (preferred), tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage; in addition, urine should be used for LF-LAM testing among those who are HIV- positive;\n\n• for children, additional specimens include gastric aspirates, nasopharyngeal aspirate and stool; in addition, urine may be used for LF-LAM testing among those who are HIV-positive; and\n\n• for people being evaluated for extrapulmonary TB, specimens that may be used are cerebro -spinal fluid, lymph node tissue aspirate, pleural tissue, pleural fluid, synovial fluid, peritoneal fluid or pericardial fluid.\n\nFor LF-LAM, midstream urine should be collected in a sterile, standard urine specimen cup at a facility with private urine collection and handwashing areas. Whenever feasible, fresh samples should be tested, ideally immediately after collection. If immediate testing is not possible, urine should be stored according to the LF-LAM manufacturer instructions for use ( 24 ) . LF-LAM testing is appropriate for all persons living with HIV being evaluated for pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB, regardless of the overall prevalence of HIV in the setting. The LF-LAM test result (<30 minutes) is likely to be available before the mWRD result and, if positive, is considered as bacteriological confirmation of TB.While LF-LAM does not differentiate between various species of the genus Mycobacterium, in areas with a high prevalence of TB, the LAM antigen detected in a clinical sample is likely to be attributed to MTBC.","tokens_est":961,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

If two specimens are collected, the first should be tested promptly using the first available mWRD . The second specimen may be used for the additional testing described in the algorithm (e.g. repeat mWRD testing for failed tests or follow-on resistance testing, or for smear microscopy or culture as a baseline for treatment monitoring).\n\nIf only one specimen can be collected (e.g. if it is difficult or impossible to obtain tissue biopsy samples), the TB diagnostic algorithm should be modified to prioritize testing with the mWRD . If additional TB testing is warranted, one option is to consider using any portion of the sample remaining after the mWRD for other tests (e.g. culture, histology, LPA and DST). Alternatively, the sample could be processed for culture in an appropriately equipped laboratory, and the same sediment could be used for the mWRD , culture and other tests. Clinical decisions should be made based on clinical judgement and the results of available laboratory tests.\n\nWith respect to the detection of MTBC, mWRD results are typically reported as “MTBC not detected”, “MTBC detected”, “no result”, “error” or “invalid”. Within the “MTBC detected” result group, some mWRDs provide semiquantitative results (high, medium, low or very low). The Xpert Ultra test has an additional semiquantitative category called “trace”.\n\n• When Xpert Ultra “trace” is used for people living with HIV and children who are being evaluated for pulmonary TB, and for individuals being evaluated for extrapulmonary TB, the “MTBC detected trace” result is considered as bacteriological confirmation of TB.\n\n• In adults who are HIV-negative and symptomatic, with a recent history of TB treatment (i.e. completed <5 years ago), Xpert Ultra “trace” results (and occasionally other mWRD “MTBC detected very low”) may be positive not because of active TB but because of the presence of non-viable bacilli. Clinical decisions must be made on all available information and clinical judgement.\n\nWith respect to the detection of RIF and INH resistance, mWRDs report the results as RIF or INH “resistance detected”, “not detected” or “indeterminate”. For the assays for which resistance detection relies on the absence of binding of wild-type reporter probes to amplicons (e.g. Truenat MTB-RIF Dx) it may be advisable to state that resistance is inferred rather than detected.\n\nWhen two mWRDs are performed (in the context of the concurrent testing strategy), and the results of the two tests are discordant for RIF status, possible errors should be investigated (e.g.\n\nwrongly labelled samples or machine error) and the resistance profile of contacts reviewed.

For people living with HIV, this applies regardless of the LF-LAM result.\n\nc. The person should be initiated on an appropriate regimen using first-line TB drugs in accordance with national guidelines.\n\nd. Additional DST should be requested in the following cases:\n\ni. Molecular or phenotypic DST for INH is indicated:\n\n if the person has been treated previously with INH or is a contact of a person known to have Hr -TB; or\n\n if there is high prevalence of INH resistance that is not associated with RIF resistance (i.e. Hr -TB or polyresistance, not MDR-TB) in this setting;\n\nIf the INH resistance is “not detected” by an MC- aNAAT and the person has a high risk of Hr -TB, phenotypic DST for INH should be performed because 6–14% of INH resistance can be missed by MC- aNAATs .\n\nii. Molecular or phenotypic DST for RIF resistance may be requested if the person is at risk of having RR-TB despite the initial mWRD result showing “resistance not detected”. Sometimes, these anomalous results may be due to sample handling errors and a repeat test may resolve the issue. False RIF-susceptible Ultra results can occur but are uncommon (1–5% of RIF-resistant TB cases tested) and the level of such results depends on the epidemiological settings. In contrast, phenotypic DST for RIF, especially using liquid culture, is associated with a higher proportion of false susceptible results ( 83 ) . The updated critical concentration for RIF should be used to reduce, but not eliminate, this issue. Sequencing should be performed when available, and should cover codons 170– 491 of the rpoB gene (including those outside of the rifampicin resistance determining region, or RRDR).\n\ne. If additional molecular or phenotypic testing is performed:\n\ni. Testing done in different laboratories should be done in parallel – it is important to not wait for the results of one test before initiating another test.\n\nii. Molecular and phenotypic DST may be performed using the specimen (direct DST) or using a culture isolate (indirect DST). Direct DST is preferred for molecular testing, whereas indirect DST may be preferred for phenotypic DST because of technical issues related to producing an appropriate inoculum and loss to contamination.\n\niii. An mWRD is preferred. Mutation interpretation can also be found in the WHO catalogue of mutations ( 23 ) . Targeted NGS is an accurate method for DST that can produce results faster than culture-based DST. Targeted NGS shows a sensitivity of almost 90% or above for detection of resistance to INH, LFX, MXF, PZA, AMK, ETB and STR, and about 70% for BDQ, LZD and CFZ for RIF-resistant samples.\n\n3. Culture-based phenotypic DST for INH and RIF often require 3–8 weeks to produce results, but may be useful for evaluating people with a susceptible molecular result, particularly in populations with a high pretest probability for resistance to INH. If the mWRD result is “MTBC detected, RIF resistance not detected and INH resistance detected” (currently only applicable to the MC- aNAAT ):\n\na. The person should be initiated on an appropriate Hr -TB regimen in accordance with national guidelines.

If the mWRD result is “MTBC detected, RIF resistance detected” Pathway 1C , an MDR-TB risk assessment is needed, irrespective of the INH result. People at high risk for MDR-TB include people who have been previously treated (e.g. those who had been lost to follow-up, relapsed or experienced a failed treatment regimen); non-converters (e.g. people who were smear positive at that end of the intensive phase of treatment for drug-susceptible TB); contacts of people with MDR-TB; and any other groups at risk for MDR-TB identified in the country. In high MDR- TB (Pathway 1C) burden countries, every person with TB is considered to be at high risk of having MDR- TB.\n\na.

If the person is not at high risk of having MDR-TB, the test should be repeated using an mWRD with a second sample. To aid interpretation, the initial instrument output for the result can be reviewed when available. Probe binding delay and samples that have low bacillary loads (e.g. Xpert Ultra semiquantitative low and very low categories) have been associated with increased false resistance in some settings ( 85–87 ) .\n\ni.

It is assumed that the repeat test will be performed with more caution, that the result of the second test will be correct, and that the result of the first test may have been due to a laboratory or clerical error. Mixed infections in high-burden settings could also explain such discordance; therefore, people should be closely followed up and tested again if the response to first-line treatment is poor.

History of prior treatment and TB contact history should be reassessed.

Discordance in resistance to INH is described in Algorithm 3. On occasion, follow-up testing is recommended to ensure that clinical decisions are well informed. However, discordant results may occur, usually when comparing culture-based results with molecular results. Each discordant result will need to be investigated on a case-by-case basis. General considerations are outlined below.\n\n1. For an mWRD result “MTBC detected other than trace”, culture negative (see Point 5 for trace):\n\na. The mWRD result and clinical judgement should be used to guide the treatment decision, pending additional testing.\n\nb. The mWRD result should be considered as bacteriological confirmation of TB if the sample was collected from a person who was not recently receiving treatment with anti-TB drugs. Cultures from individuals with pulmonary TB may be negative for several reasons, including that the person is being treated for TB (effective treatment rapidly renders MTBC non-viable), transport or processing problems have inactivated the tubercle bacilli, cultures have been lost to contamination, the testing volume was inadequate, or a laboratory or clerical error occurred.\n\nc. Follow-up actions may include re-evaluating the person for TB, reassessing the possibility of prior or current treatment with anti-TB drugs (including FQ use), evaluating response to therapy, and evaluating the possibility of laboratory or clerical error.\n\n2. mWRD result “MTB not detected”, culture positive:\n\na. The treatment decision should be based on the culture result. If the person started treatment based on clinical judgement, treatment should be continued and the person recorded as having bacteriologically confirmed TB.\n\nb. The culture-positive result should be considered as bacteriological confirmation of TB because culture is the current gold standard for the laboratory confirmation of TB. Using a sputum specimen, WRDs have a pooled sensitivity of 83–90% for detecting pulmonary TB compared with culture ( 91 ) . Their sensitivity is lower in people living with HIV, children and other specimen types such as CSF.\n\nc. False positive cultures can result from a variety of causes, such as cross-contamination in the laboratory (e.g. from inappropriate specimen processing) or sample labelling problems. In well-functioning laboratories, such errors are rare.\n\nd. Follow-up actions may include re-evaluating the person for TB, conducting additional testing using mWRDs , culturing additional samples, and evaluating the possibility of laboratory or clerical error. If the person was initiated on anti-TB therapy based on clinical judgement, the response to therapy should be evaluated.\n\n3. mWRD result “MTBC detected, RIF resistance detected ”; RIF susceptible by phenotypic DST:\n\na. The mWRD result should be used to guide treatment decisions pending additional testing.\n\nb. Borderline resistant mutations are known to generate this discordant result, particularly in the BACTEC MGIT system (i.e. a false susceptible phenotypic result). In people infected with strains carrying these mutations treatment with RIF-based first-line regimens often fails ( 83 ) .\n\nc. In some settings with a low prevalence of MDR-TB, silent mutations have been observed that generate a false resistant mWRD result, but these are rare.\n\nd. A review of the probe melting temperatures when available ( 92 ) or banding pattern on the FL-LPA can aid in determining or inferring the specific mutation (e.g. borderline resistant or silent).\n\ne.

The treatment regimen should be modified based on the results of the phenotypic DST.\n\nb. False RIF-susceptible mWRD results are rare but have been observed in 1–5% of RIF-resistant TB cases tested with the Ultra test in various epidemiological settings. Mutations in the RRDR of the rpoB gene have been shown to account for 95–99% of RIF resistance. The remainder of RIF resistance arises from mutations outside RRDR, which produce an Xpert MTB/RIF result of “RIF resistance not detected”. In settings with a prevalent clone that harbours a mutation outside the RRDR – for example, Eswatini ( 93 ) –this may be more common; however, this has not been identified as a major concern in other settings\n\n( 94 ) . Surveillance to monitor emergence of such clones over time should be considered.\n\nc. Follow-up actions may include DNA sequencing, repeating the phenotypic DST, and evaluating the possibility of laboratory or clerical error.\n\n5. Xpert Ultra “MTBC detected trace”, culture negative – the interpretation of this result must consider the person’s characteristics, the specimen type and whether the person had been previously treated for TB:\n\n Cultures may be negative for several reasons, including the person being treated for TB or treated with FQs, transport or processing problems that inactivated the tubercle bacilli, culture contamination or inadequate testing volume, or laboratory or clerical error.\n\n The small numbers of bacilli in a sample that generates an “MTBC detected trace” result may be due to active TB disease, laboratory cross-contamination, recent exposure to (or infection with) tubercle bacilli (i.e. incipient TB), and current or past treatment for TB.\n\n The FIND multicentre study revealed that many of the samples that generated results of “MTBC detected trace” and culture negative were from individuals who had completed therapy within the past 4–5 years, presumably because of the presence of small numbers of non-viable or non-replicating bacilli. Thus, “MTBC detected trace” results must be interpreted within the context of prior treatment.\n\na.

The selected regimen should be adjusted if needed, based on DST results that may become available after initiation of treatment.\n\n– WHO recommends molecular tests for the detection of mutations associated with resistance to FQs (LC- aNAAT , SL-LPA and targeted NGS tests) and mutations associated with BDQ resistance (targeted NGS tests). Targeted NGS tests can also detect mutations associated with resistance to some of the other drugs included in MDR-TB regimens (e.g. LZD, CFZ and PZA).\n\n– WHO recommends a molecular test for PZA resistance detection belonging to the class “HC- rNAAT ”. Its use is limited to culture isolates. Alternatively, pncA sequencing should be performed when available.\n\n• In settings where targeted NGS is not available, phenotypic DST should be used.\n\n– In a quality-assured laboratory, with careful attention to inoculum preparation, a susceptible phenotypic DST result using MGIT for PZA can be used to guide the inclusion of PZA in a DR-TB treatment regimen ( Web Annex C ).\n\n– Reliable phenotypic DST methods are available for RIF, INH, FQs, BDQ, CFZ, Pa, CS, LZD, AMK and DLM. Testing algorithms that rely on culture and phenotypic DST are described in the relevant WHO policy framework ( 96 ) and technical manual ( Web Annex C ). Member States should ensure that there is capacity for DST for drugs used for treatment and for which reliable testing is available.\n\n– No reliable phenotypic DST methods are available for EMB, ETO/ prothionamide , or imipenem- cilastatin /MPM; hence, results should not be used for clinical decision-making.\n\n– If phenotypic DST to second-line drugs is not available in-country, specimens or isolates may be shipped to an external laboratory for testing (e.g. a WHO supranational reference laboratory [SRL]).

If the targeted NGS test result is indeterminate, the test can be repeated with a fresh sample in cases where the bacterial load is expected to give a definitive result (smear positive or high or medium grade on mWRD ); treatment decisions should be based on clinical assessment, the epidemiological situation and the results of phenotypic DST.

BDQ is a core drug of all 6-month and 9-month MDR/RR-TB regimens, and the interpretation of the targeted NGS results has important implications for treatment choices. It is necessary to evaluate the pretest probability of BDQ resistance before making clinical decisions, because of the suboptimal performance of the targeted NGS test for detecting BDQ resistance (sensitivity: 67.9%, 95% CI: 42.6–93.2%; specificity: 97.0%, 95% CI: 94.3–99.7%). A low risk for BDQ/CFZ resistance is when there is no prior BDQ/CFZ exposure, AND the prevalence of resistance to BDQ/CFZ is less than 5% in the population, AND there is no history of contact with a person known to have BDQ/CFZ-resistant TB. If any of these conditions are NOT met the risk is considered high.\n\na. If the risk of BDQ resistance is low and the targeted NGS test does not detect mutations associated with resistance to BDQ, the negative predictive value will be high, and the result is likely to be true. In cases of FQ resistance, one of two 6-month regimens should be used but the FQ should be dropped (i.e. BPaL or BDLC [BDQ, DLM, LZD and CFZ] should be used, assuming that tests show susceptibility to LZD). The 9-month regimens recommended by WHO should not be used. In cases of susceptibility to FQ, the selected 6-month or 9-month regimen should be continued, or one of the other 6-month or 9-month regimens should be adapted based on the full targeted NGS profile. The decision to perform phenotypic DST for BDQ for this group will be context dependent, taking into account the prevalence of resistance, DST capacity and the expected number missed by targeted NGS. Ideally, where resources are available, phenotypic DST should be done for all samples. The regimen should be modified as appropriate if resistance to other medicines in the regimen is detected.","tokens_est":942,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

General considerations\n\n• WHO guidelines stress the importance of DST before treatment, especially for medicines for which genotypic DST is available.\n\n• People with TB that is RIF susceptible, INH susceptible or unknown should be started on a first-line regimen for drug-susceptible TB ( 7 ) .\n\n• Globally, Hr -TB prevalence is 7.4% (95% CI: 6.5–8.4%) in new cases and 11.4% (95% CI: 9.4– 13.4%) in people who were treated previously ( 98 ) . The prevalence in some settings can exceed 25% ( 98 ) . Contacts of a person known to have Hr -TB are also at increased risk. The prevalence of any INH resistance is particularly high in some parts of the WHO European Region and Western Pacific Region.\n\n• Hr -TB is currently undetected in many settings but is clinically important. Compared with people with drug-susceptible TB, people with Hr -TB who are treated with the recommended regimen for drug-susceptible TB have a much higher risk of treatment failure (11% versus 2%), relapse (10% versus 5%) and acquiring additional drug resistance (8% versus 1%) ( 98 ) .\n\n• The successful treatment of Hr -TB, prevention of the spread of Hr -TB and acquisition of resistance to additional drugs such as RIF rely on rapidly detecting people with Hr -TB and\n\nplacing them on effective treatment regimens. The LC- aNAATs for follow-up detection of INH resistance can be valuable tools because they are easy to use and can be implemented in the lower levels of the health system.\n\n• The recommended Hr -TB treatment regimen is RIF, EMB, PZA and LFX for 6 months ( 7 , 99 ) .\n\n• Targeted NGS tests report results for many medicines not used for treatment of drug- susceptible TB (e.g. BDQ, LZD, CFZ, AMK and STR). These results should not be released for people with RIF-susceptible TB; however, if the results are released, it should be made clear that these medicines are only to be used for individualized regimens in specialized circumstances.\n\n• Reliable phenotypic DST methods are available for RIF, INH, FQs, BDQ, CFZ, Pa, CS, LZD, AMK and DLM. Testing algorithms that rely on culture and phenotypic DST are described in the WHO policy framework ( 96 ) and technical manual ( Web Annex C ). Member States should ensure there is capacity for DST for drugs that are used for treatment and for which reliable testing is available.\n\n• No reliable phenotypic DST methods are available for EMB, ETO/ prothionamide , or imipenem- cilastatin /MPM; hence, results for these medicines should not be used for clinical decision-making.\n\n• Initiation of treatment should not be delayed while waiting for the results of DST.","tokens_est":653,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Treatment with an Hr -TB regimen should be initiated ( 7 ) :\n\ni. There is no clear evidence showing that adding INH at the usual doses benefits or harms people. For the convenience of the people being treated and for ease of administration, the four-drug INH/RIF/EMB/PZA (HREZ) fixed-dose combination tablets may be used to deliver the Hr -TB regimen, alongside LFX.\n\nii. Emerging evidence suggests that people infected with strains with only inhA promoter mutations and corresponding modest increases in minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) may benefit from high-dose INH therapy. Thus, additional INH – up to a maximum dose of 15 mg/kg per day – may be considered for use with the Hr -TB regimen for such isolates. The added value of INH in the regimen, even when used at the higher dose, declines as MICs increase further.\n\nc. A specimen should be referred from a person with laboratory-confirmed Hr -TB for molecular (e.g. LC- aNAAT or SL-LPA) or phenotypic DST for FQs and PZA.

SL-LPA can be used with smear-positive or smear-negative specimens, although the indeterminate rate will be higher when testing smear-negative specimens.\n\n Despite the good specificity and sensitivity of LC- aNAATs and SL-LPA for the detection of FQ resistance, phenotypic DST is required to completely exclude resistance to individual FQs. In particular, phenotypic DST may be needed in settings with a high pretest probability for resistance to FQ, to exclude resistance when the SL-LPA does not detect mutations associated with resistance.\n\nd.

It is important as a first step to exclude possible administrative errors (specimen mislabelling or switching) by reviewing the tests conducted at or around the same time. Reviewing the patient history is also useful because that may highlight a long history with a possibility that an individual may be harbouring more than one strain of Mtb . Technical issues could also be the cause – although the tests are expected to perform similarly, they are not identical; in addition, sample-to-sample variability complicated the issue. Each discordant result will need to be investigated on a case-by-case basis. A few examples are outlined below.\n\n1. Where the mWRD (e.g. Xpert Ultra) result is “MTBC detected”, and the follow-on FL-LPA result is “MTB not detected” or “uninterpretable”:\n\na. The mWRDs recommended for detection of TB have a lower LoD than the FL-LPA; thus, FL-LPA may fail to detect TB in mWRD -positive samples that contain few bacilli. For example, it is estimated that only about 80% of specimens with “MTBC detected” by Xpert MTB/RIF will generate an FL-LPA result that can be interpreted.\n\nb. The initial mWRD result should be used to guide treatment decisions, pending additional testing.\n\nc. Follow-up actions may include submitting a specimen for culture and a molecular or phenotypic testing of the recovered isolate, and evaluating the possibility of laboratory or clerical error.\n\n2. Where the initial mWRD result is “MTBC detected, RIF resistance not detected” and the sample is RIF resistant by FL-LPA:\n\na. Treatment decisions should be based on the FL-LPA result (i.e. based on the worst-case scenario).\n\nb. This result is expected to be rare because both assays interrogate the same region of the rpoB gene. There have been reports of mWRD RIF-susceptible and FL-LPA RIF-resistant discordances, but the data are too sparse to assess how often this occurs.\n\nc. FL-LPA is more sensitive for identifying RIF resistance than most mWRDs in heteroresistant populations (i.e. mixtures of susceptible and resistant bacteria). The test includes hybridization probes specific to both the common mutated and the wild-type sequences in the bacterial genome. If the Xpert Ultra is used, a review of the probe melting temperature curves may help to identify heteroresistant populations (e.g. dual peak).\n\nd. Follow-up actions may include DNA sequencing, conducting phenotypic DST, and evaluating the possibility of laboratory or clerical error.\n\n3. Where the MC- aNAAT result is “MTBC detected, RIF resistance not detected, INH resistance detected” but the result is “INH susceptible” by LC- aNAAT :\n\na. This result is expected to be rare because both assays interrogate the same region of the\n\nkatG and inhA genes.\n\nb.

The risk of Hr -TB should be reassessed; if the reason is found not to be a high risk of Hr -TB or administration errors (e.g. mislabelling ), treatment decisions should cover the worst-case scenario and be based on the MC- aNAAT result.\n\n4.

Children aged under 5 years and people living with HIV do not require testing for TB infection; for these groups, TPT can be initiated if TB disease can be ruled out. TB screening could be performed, for example, by assessing TB symptoms or using more sensitive WHO-recommended tools such as CXR, with or without computer-aided detection, mWRDs or C-reactive protein (the latter only applies to people living with HIV) ( 55 ) . Sequential screening and diagnostic testing (first for TB disease, then for TB infection) may incur substantial delays or losses in testing for TB infection, particularly if these tasks are performed by different health care personnel or in different locations. Hence, during the first health care encounter, it is preferable to combine screening for TB disease with testing for TB infection. People with symptoms that are suggestive of TB disease should undergo further evaluation as soon as possible, preferably on the same visit ( 5 ) . If onsite testing is available for TB disease and TB is confirmed, TB treatment should be promptly initiated, though this is unlikely in many settings.\n\nThe second visit may be optimized for the following: reading the TST or TBST or obtaining the IGRA result; reviewing the results of microbiological tests for TB disease if the person had a positive TB screen and submitted samples for TB testing; undertaking clinical evaluation to rule out TB or before starting TB treatment; and starting TPT or TB treatment. This second visit should\n\noccur 48–72 hours after the test. If the test for TB infection is negative, the individual can be discharged; however, a repeat test for TB infection may be required if an initial test is negative, particularly in people with very recent exposure or concomitant viral infection. When the test for TB infection is positive in contacts who were asymptomatic initially, or who had symptoms but in whom TB disease was excluded, the person should be re-evaluated for immediate initiation of TPT ( Fig. 6.7 ). Although TB infection tests may be positive in the presence of TB disease, their low accuracy means that these tests are not recommended for screening or as part of the diagnostic work-up of presumptive TB; this should be emphasized during the training of health workers.\n\nIt is proposed that tests for TB infection for eligible individuals be conducted early in the assessment of people at risk of TB (i.e. during the first visit) because this would help to reduce delays in starting the appropriate treatment; also, the test result may be helpful when deciding the best course of action in most of the people tested. If a person has no symptoms at screening, evaluation to exclude TB disease may still be warranted, and CXR increases the sensitivity in such situations. Ideally, all these activities should be done on the same day, so that TPT can be prescribed during the second visit as soon as test results are available. Because most people with TB symptoms are not expected to have TB disease, deferring the test for TB infection to a later stage (e.g. after further work-up) in such individuals may result in significant losses.","tokens_est":977,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Hence, the programme should ensure that the referral pathways and medical services are well organized before launching testing for TB infection, and that the mechanisms for clinical assessment, start of medication and treatment support are all available (Section 2). An advantage of skin testing for TB infection (using TST or TBST) is the capacity to administer the test and read the result in 48 hours at the POC. The portable nature of the supplies and temperature-controlled reagents needed for the test mean that testing can be done at home or in remote communities. However, these advantages are lost if the subsequent evaluation to exclude TB disease and the provision of TPT are not equally accessible. Hence, a decision to expand access to testing for TB infection needs to be matched by efforts to expand access to the medical services needed for management of those with positive test results.","tokens_est":268,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

In this manual, the focus is on the detection of mutations associated with drug resistance for the surveillance of drug resistance in tuberculosis (TB). The implementation guidance is also appropriate for the implementation of targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) tests to detect mutations associated with drug resistance, to guide clinical decision-making for treatment of drug-resistant TB (DR-TB).\n\nThis implementation manual complements two other publications on TB:\n\n• The use of next-generation sequencing technologies for the detection of mutations associated with drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex: technical guide ( 2 ) – this document provides an overview of NGS methods and workflows, and a comprehensive review of the scientific evidence on characterization of the genetic basis of phenotypic drug resistance to major anti-TB medicines; and\n\n• The second edition of the Catalogue of mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and their association with drug resistance ( 3 ) .\n\nThe technical guide ( 2 ) offers a framework for making decisions about NGS-based drug susceptibility testing (DST), a roadmap for implementation, and practical guidance for country planning and implementation of NGS-based DST.

The main steps are as follows:\n\n1. Define the intended immediate and future use of NGS tests in the country, in line with the objectives of the country’s national strategic plan (NSP) for TB. This will have important implications for the choice of technologies and equipment to use, the selection of a site or sites for conducting testing, specimen referral systems and target turnaround times for results.\n\n2.

Establish forecasting, ordering and distribution procedures to ensure a reliable and timely supply of quality-assured reagents and consumables.\n\n5. Develop and deploy a well-defined, comprehensive set of standard operating procedures (SOPs) to address all aspects of the laboratory testing process, from sample collection to reporting of results. Provide clear decision-making guidance for the selection of people for NGS-based DST.\n\n6. Secure adequate storage capacity and processes for backup and retrieval of the large amounts of data generated by NGS; select and implement relevant bioinformatic tools to analyse and interpret NGS data; and develop SOPs for data security, sharing and ensuring confidentiality.\n\n7.

Key considerations in DS-TB treatment | 2.1 TB diagnostics and DST","content_type":"text","pages":"9-10","text":"2.1 TB diagnostics and DST\n\nInnovative rapid molecular tests to diagnose both pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB in all populations are strongly recommended over sputum smear microscopy and culture methods, because rapid tests can provide same day results (3) . Some of the innovative tests also provide drug susceptibility results for rifampicin (R), isoniazid (H) and fluoroquinolones (FQ), allowing rapid confirmation of diagnosis, and timely and effective treatment allocation. Based on the data from global TB drugresistance surveillance, rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB) is rare when people are first diagnosed with TB, but it is reaching alarming proportions in some countries. Globally, the burden of multidrugresistant TB (MDR-TB) or RR-TB (MDR/RR-TB) is stable (4) . For more than 10 years, the best estimate of the proportion of people diagnosed with TB for the first time who had MDR/RR-TB has remained at about 3–4%, and the best estimate among those previously treated for TB has remained at about 18–21% (3) . The highest proportions (>50% in previously treated cases) are found in countries in eastern Europe and Central Asia (4) .\n\nResistance to FQ in new TB patients without resistance to rifampicin is rare in most of the countries with available data (1.0–1.2%), although some countries show higher proportions (3.4–11.2%) (5–9) . Isoniazid-resistant and rifampicin-susceptible TB is the most prevalent form of drug resistance worldwide (besides streptomycin resistance), with estimates rising to 7% among those newly diagnosed and 8–11% among those previously treated (4, 10) . Isoniazid-resistant TB is associated with a higher risk of acquiring further drug resistance and evolving towards MDR-TB, which is defined by resistance to both isoniazid and rifampicin (11–13) .\n\nThese data reiterate the importance of full transition from sputum smear microscopy to the widespread use of rapid diagnostic tests, especially in those with recurrent TB. Regular country reports to WHO and several surveys clearly demonstrate that the policy of using rapid molecular TB diagnostic tests has been widely adopted in countries with a significant burden of TB. However, the use of rapid TB testing has yet to surpass the use of smear microscopy (14–16) .\n\nWith the range of available anti-TB medicines and treatment regimens, drug susceptibility testing (DST) for key drugs is crucial for the choice of an appropriate treatment strategy. For medicines with high potency against Mycobacterium tuberculosis – rifampicin, moxifloxacin (M) and isoniazid – rapid tests for drug susceptibility are now available and evidence-based recommendations for their use are given in relevant WHO documents (3, 17) .\n\nResistance to rifampicin renders all of the available regimens for DS-TB ineffective; if rifampicin is used, it may cause both treatment failure and development of additional resistance to other drugs in the regimen. This finding means that the treatment strategy for DR-TB needs to be changed. Among new TB patients without resistance to rifampicin, resistance to FQ is very low; this allows a general strategy of starting these patients on DS-TB regimens (including the 4-month regimen with moxifloxacin described in Section 4), without obligatory DST for FQ. This general strategy should be regularly revisited and updated in response to the drug-surveillance data of the country or specific setting, to prevent potential misuse of moxifloxacin (an important medicine for treatment of DR-TB) and increased antimicrobial resistance. Resistance to isoniazid leads to decreased efficacy of the 6-month regimen (described in Section 3) and requires use of the specific regimens that include FQ. The effect of isoniazid monoresistance on the efficacy of the 4-month regimen with rifapentine (P) and moxifloxacin has not been studied; however, the efficacy of the 4-month regimen for children (2HRZ(E)/2HR, described in Section 5) is expected to be affected.","tokens_est":991,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Although universal DST is the goal, priority should be given to testing patients undergoing retreatment at, or before, the start of that retreatment – at least for isoniazid and rifampicin resistance. Whenever rifampicin resistance is confirmed, testing for resistance to FQ will be important in the design of an effective treatment regimen.\n\nIn settings where rapid DST results are not routinely available to guide the management of individual patients, the approach to treatment selection can be guided by clinical judgement and consideration of the epidemiology of TB and its drug-resistant forms in the specific setting.

The 6-month regimen has become the standard of care all over the world but efforts have been made to develop effective shorter regimens to treat DS-TB. Several trials were designed to assess whether a shorter treatment regimen can remain highly effective and raise no additional safety concerns. Based on the results of recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs), WHO has recommended two different 4-month regimens: one based on the Study 31 trial and one based on the SHINE trial (1) .\n\nCurrent recommendations cover regimens that differ in duration, composition and dosing of drug components. In addition, the eligible populations (depending on the available evidence) differ in terms of age and TB disease severity. The three recommended regimens are as follows:\n\n• The 6-month regimen (2HRZ(E)4HR, described in Section 3 ) comprises 2 months of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide (Z) and ethambutol (E), followed by 4 months of isoniazid and rifampicin. This regimen is recommended in all patient populations. In children (usually defined as being aged <10 years), the inclusion of ethambutol in the first 2 months of treatment is recommended in settings with a high prevalence of HIV, in settings with isoniazid resistance or in children living with HIV (CLHIV), but can otherwise be omitted, resulting in the 2HRZ/4HR regimen (19) .\n\n• The 4-month regimen HPMZ (described in Section 4 ) comprises 2 months of isoniazid, rifapentine, moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide, followed by 2 months of rifapentine, isoniazid and moxifloxacin. This regimen is recommended for all those aged above 12 years, whatever the severity of TB disease.\n\n• The 4-month regimen HRZ(E) (described in Section 5 ) comprises 2 months of isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide, with or without ethambutol, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for 2 months for those aged between 3 months and 16 years, with non-severe pulmonary or peripheral lymph node TB.

It is preferred that CLHIV who receive the 4-month regimen receive that regimen with ethambutol for the first 2 months of treatment, irrespective of the background prevalence of HIV. In addition, it is strongly recommended that ethambutol be added to the 4-month regimen for the first 2 months in settings with a high background prevalence of isoniazid resistance or HIV infection.\n\nThe 6-month regimen comprising 2HRZ(E)/4HR can be used in all patients in all age groups, independent of the disease severity and HIV status. However, in patients aged under 10 years, ethambutol can also be omitted in patients who are HIV-negative or in settings with a low prevalence of HIV and isoniazid resistance.\n\nIn patients with DS-TB aged 12 years or more, another possible treatment option is the regimen comprising 2HPMZ/2HPM. This regimen can be used in patients with both severe and non-severe forms of the disease , and in people living with HIV (PLHIV). Access, the pill burden and the cost of the HPMZ regimen may present barriers for implementation until rifapentine becomes more widely and readily available at costs comparable with rifampicin, and the fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet is developed and becomes available. In some cases, patient and family preference may also guide the choice of the regimen if several regimen options apply to the patient once all other factors have been considered.\n\nIn summary, for treatment of DS-TB, WHO recommends either a 6-month regimen or, in specific subgroups of patients, either of two new 4-month regimens (as presented in Table 1.2.1 ).\n\nIn patients who require TB retreatment, rapid DST should be performed to guide the regimen approach; that is, to determine whether the treatment should be for DS-TB or DR-TB. In 2017, the WHO Guideline Development Group (GDG) agreed to abolish the former Category II standard 8-month regimen (2HRZES/1HRZE/5HRE), which comprised an intensive phase of 3 months (2 months of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and streptomycin followed by 1 month without streptomycin), followed by a continuation phase of 5 months with isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol. The GDG put forward a good practice statement that this 8-month regimen should no longer be prescribed, and that DST should be conducted to inform the choice of the treatment regimen.\n\nThe three current regimen formulations and their durations are summarized below.","tokens_est":671,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

The regimen ensures a successful outcome in about 85% of patients globally, and has a low proportion of unfavourable outcomes and adverse events (AEs), although the success rate varies among WHO regions and is lower in PLHIV (1, 4) .

The effect of a patient missing one or more doses (either accidentally or due to stock-outs) is much more significant if the regimen is intermittent. The term “daily” indicates an intake of anti-TB drugs for 7 days per week. In patients with DS-TB, WHO does not recommend thrice-weekly dosing for either the intensive or the continuation phase of treatment as described in this recommendation:\n\nRecommendation 1.3: In all patients with drug-susceptible pulmonary TB, the use of thrice-weekly dosing is not recommended in both the intensive and continuation phases of therapy and daily dosing remains the recommended dosing frequency (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)\n\nWHO recommends the use of FDC tablets, as included in the recommendation below:\n\nRecommendation 1.4: The use of fixed-dose combination tablets is recommended over separate drug formulations in treatment of patients with drug-susceptible TB (Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence).\n\nWHO recommends not prolonging the continuation phase of treatment of the 6-month regimen in new pulmonary TB patients if a sputum smear is found to be positive at the end of the intensive phase of treatment, as included in the recommendation below:\n\nRecommendation 1.5: In new pulmonary TB patients treated with the regimen containing rifampicin throughout treatment, if a positive sputum smear is found at completion of the intensive phase, the extension of the intensive phase is not recommended (Strong recommendation, high certainty of evidence).","tokens_est":949,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

The regimen is a combination of those four drugs (i.e. HRZE) for 2 months followed by isoniazid and rifampicin (i.e. HR) for 4 months, administered daily. In children (usually defined as being aged <10 years) in settings with a high background prevalence of isoniazid resistance or HIV infection, or in CLHIV, ethambutol should be used in the first 2 months of treatment; in all other situations ethambutol can be omitted, resulting in a 2HRZ/4HR regimen (19) .\n\nAs a general rule , WHO does not recommend prolonging the regimen beyond 6 months (1) , because there is evidence that prolongation does not significantly increase efficacy. The first 2 months of treatment, which includes four drugs, is usually enough for the strong bactericidal activity of this regimen to be effective. Thus, the presence of one or more sputum smear results that are still positive after 2 months usually indicates the presence of dead bacilli; however, in some cases, it might be due to undetected resistance to one or more drugs. If the patient is not improving clinically and radiologically, and drug resistance or potential failure is suspected, rapid diagnostic testing to exclude these scenarios should be undertaken promptly, together with culture and DST, to provide a basis for any adjustment of the treatment strategy (21) .\n\nThe systematic reviews on the dosages of the first-line medicines (rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide) used in the treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis in adults and children were conducted.

In settings where DST results are not yet routinely available to guide the management of individual patients, patient history and clinical judgement are used to make decisions on the empirical use of this regimen.\n\nDiagnostic challenges include being a long distance from the facilities where quality TB diagnostics are available, technical difficulties in implementing these tests and difficultly in accessing health services. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has further complicated rapid and universal access to quality TB diagnosis. Also, diagnosis of TB in children is particularly challenging.\n\nNTPs should obtain and use their country-specific drug-resistance surveillance (DRS) to estimate the level of MDR/RR-TB. Periodic drug-resistance surveys or ongoing surveillance in each country are essential for monitoring the impact of the regimen and the overall treatment programme (1) .\n\nTo improve treatment adherence and minimize the acquisition of MDR/RR-TB, it is critical for NTPs to ensure adequate treatment support in the context of patient- centred care. Implementing treatment support and care requires resources to ensure optimal adherence and provide patient education and counselling (1) . It is important to educate and support patients, to ensure that they complete treatment with all the prescribed doses within the planned period of time (1) .\n\nDaily dosing is considered optimal because it reduces the probability of selecting resistant mutants. However, such dosing may be challenging for NTPs in terms of providing daily treatment support.\n\nThe use of FDCs may provide programmatic benefits by making it easier to order medicines, simplifying supply chain management, reducing the occurrence of stock-outs, and facilitating drug delivery and prescription. FDCs with proven bioavailability may also provide additional benefits, especially in settings with many TB patients and a limited number of health care workers, because FDCs reduce the need for additional health care staff and for training in dosing and dispensing of medications, while contributing to a lower pill burden for patients. However, because use of FDCs lacks the flexibility that is available when using loose tablet formulations, FDCs do not always provide optimal dosing in all individuals (1) .\n\nNTPs need to procure a quantity of loose or single drug formulations for certain treatment conditions. Having single drug formulations available would also be beneficial to programmes in cases of adverse reactions to TB medications, when drugs must be reintroduced one at a time (see Section 8 for details) (1) .","tokens_est":736,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

When the 6-month rifampicin-containing regimen is used, these drug interactions may result in decreased concentrations of antiretroviral drugs. In 2016, WHO published key considerations for managing concomitant TB and HIV therapy (22) . Standard, rifampicin-containing anti-TB treatment was recommended in combination with efavirenz-based ART. Conversely, key contraindicated drug combinations were rifampicin with nevirapine and protease inhibitors. In people with HIV-associated TB receiving these drugs, rifabutin (where available) was suggested as a suitable substitute for rifampicin.\n\nRifampicin is known to lower plasma concentrations of the HIV medication dolutegravir. This has led to concerns about efficacy and the development of HIV resistance due to lower levels of dolutegravir. In such cases, WHO guidelines recommend adjusting the dose by offering 50 mg of dolutegravir twice per day (instead of a single daily dose of 50 mg) (22) . These recommendations are still in place, although evidence that doubling the dose of dolutegravir might not be necessary is emerging. A study from Botswana demonstrated the efficacy and safety of a standard-dose dolutegravir-based regimen compatible with an efavirenz-based regimen for HIV-positive TB patients who received rifampicin (23) .","tokens_est":364,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

In the continuation phase, dormant bacilli are eliminated to effect cure and prevent relapse. The choice of TB treatment regimen depends on the severity of disease and age.

All CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS LIVING WITH HIV in the SHINE trial received ethambutol in the first 2 months of treatment (regardless of which regimen they received). It is therefore preferred that children and adolescents living with HIV who receive the 4-month regimen receive ethambutol for the first 2 months of treatment, irrespective of the background prevalence of HIV. In addition, it is recommended that ethambutol be added to the 4-month regimen for the first 2 months in settings with a high background prevalence of isoniazid resistance or HIV infection. Also, for this regimen, daily dosing (i.e. 7 days per week), ideally under direct observation, is suggested, taking advantage of a treatment supporter or VST.\n\nThe doses are the same as those recommended for the 6-month regimen 2HRZE/4HR ( Annex 4 ).\n\nTreatment should be continued for 6 months or should be modified in children and adolescents who have not responded clinically (i.e. have not demonstrated weight gain or resolution of TB symptoms) after 4 months of treatment. These people should be evaluated carefully for DR-TB, nonTB -related disease (e.g. malignancy or HIV-related lung disease) and poor treatment adherence. The first 2 months of treatment, which includes three or four drugs, is usually enough for the strong bactericidal activity of this regimen to be effective. If the patients are sputum smear negative (or paucibacillary) and no cavities are present in CXR, then the presence of one or more sputum smear results that are positive after 2 months may indicate undetected resistance to one or more drugs. If the patient is not improving clinically and radiologically (e.g. cavities appear), and drug resistance or potential failure are suspected, rapid diagnostics to exclude this should be done promptly together with culture and DST, to provide a basis for any adjustment of the treatment strategy.","tokens_est":586,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

At lower levels of the health care system, access to CXR is often limited or the quality of CXR and the capacity for interpretation may be suboptimal; this can have equity implications, because of the out - of-pocket expenses it might cause. Therefore, the feasibility of CXR varies by setting. It is important to clearly define “non-severe” disease, and NTPs are encouraged to scale up access to quality CXR and train health care providers in its interpretation. If the severity of TB disease in children can be adequately determined under programmatic conditions, then implementation of a 4-month regimen is highly feasible.\n\nThe feasibility of assessing the severity of TB disease is a major consideration for implementation, particularly in settings without access to CXR or the capacity for CXR interpretation, and in settings without access to WHO-recommended diagnostic tests. CXR is a critical tool for evaluation of the severity of intrathoracic disease. Extensive or advanced pulmonary TB disease in children aged under 15 years is usually defined by the presence of cavities or bilateral disease on CXR (17) . As indicated above, non-severe TB disease refers to peripheral lymph node TB; intrathoracic lymph node TB without airway obstruction; uncomplicated TB pleural effusion; or paucibacillary, non-cavitary disease, confined to one lobe of the lungs, and without a miliary pattern.\n\nDetailed implementation guidance is provided in the operational handbook on the management of TB in children and adolescents (31) . The guidance takes into consideration differences in the health care system and country context, including the availability of diagnostic tools for making a diagnosis and assessing disease severity. This guidance includes criteria for assessing disease severity (including clinical criteria in the absence of CXR or rapid diagnostics or other bacteriological tests) to determine eligibility for the shorter regimen.","tokens_est":546,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

The 4-month regimen with rifapentine and moxifloxacin has also been shown to perform well in patients who are also HIV-positive (1) . The evidence on the use of this 4-month regimen in people living with HIV was limited to those with a CD4 count of above 100 cells/mm 3 ; hence, the CD4 count value below 100 cells/mm 3 is currently used in excluding people living with HIV from the shorter regimen. For people living with HIV with a CD4 count above that threshold, both regimens can be used.\n\nChildren living with HIV were eligible for enrolment in the SHINE trial. In view of the limited evidence available from the trial, clinicians may consider treating children living with HIV with non-severe TB for 4 months with 2HRZE/2HR, depending on the degree of immunosuppression and ART status, as well as the presence of other opportunistic infections. These children and adolescents will need to be monitored closely, especially at 4 months of treatment.\n\nAs discussed above, all people living with HIV (especially those with TB) should receive ART.

Outside WHO recommendations, some experts suggest 9–12 months of treatment for tuberculous meningitis (given the serious risk of disability and mortality) (41) , and 9 months of treatment for osteoarticular TB (given the difficulties in assessing treatment response) (41, 44–46) .\n\nTreatment of extrapulmonary TB is similar to that of pulmonary TB, being centred around the 6-month 2HRZE/4HR regimen; however, the regimen can be prolonged up to 12 months for tuberculous meningitis, osteoarticular TB or other types of extrapulmonary TB, as decided by clinicians. The 4-month 2HPMZ/2HPM regimen was not studied in extrapulmonary TB and thus cannot be recommended at this time. Furthermore, extrapulmonary TB is usually more difficult to diagnose, and evaluation of its outcomes can be more challenging because of the absence of bacteriological evidence in most patients and the need for cross-sectional imaging; hence, there is little quality evidence on this type of TB.\n\nFollowing infection with M. tuberculosis , young children are at high risk of developing the most severe forms of disease, the most devastating being tuberculous meningitis, which predominantly affects young children (peak age of onset, 2–4 years). WHO currently recommends a 12-month regimen to treat tuberculous meningitis in children, comprising isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol given daily for the first 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin given daily for an additional 10 months (2HRZE/10HR) (19) . Recommended doses to be used in this regimen are the same as those for the treatment of pulmonary TB. This regimen can be used in all children and adolescents, including those who are HIV-positive.\n\nAn alternative option of a shorter regimen is also conditionally recommended. This shorter regimen is recommended for children and adolescents with bacteriologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed tuberculous meningitis (without suspicion or evidence of MDR/RR-TB); it is a 6-month intensive regimen that comprises isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethionamide (6HRZEto) (19) . It is preferable to use child-friendly, dispersible and FDC medicines in children when possible.\n\nIn cases of non-severe TB, the 4-month 2HRZ(E)/2HR regimen (see Section 5 for details) can be used for children and adolescents with peripheral lymph node TB, intrathoracic lymph node TB without airway obstruction and uncomplicated TB pleural effusion (1) .\n\nChildren with peripheral lymph node TB were included in the SHINE trial, and the results showed that the 4-month regimen (2HRZ(E)/2HR) can be used in children and adolescents aged between 3 months and 16 years with extrathoracic lymph node TB, which falls under the definition of nonsevere TB (1) .

The mortality benefit increased with the increasing severity of disease. Additionally, rates of AEs and severe AEs, including severe hepatitis, were lower in patients receiving steroids; hence, steroids should be given regardless of the severity of meningitis.\n\nIn patients with tuberculous pericarditis, a systematic review (53–60) found a benefit to steroid treatment in relation to death, constrictive pericarditis and treatment adherence. When the studies were considered individually, the largest (1400 patients) and most recent study – the Investigation of the Management of Pericarditis (IMPI) study – showed no benefit of steroids (55) . However, a factor complicating these findings is HIV infection. In the IMPI study, 67% of subjects were HIV-positive and only 14% were on ART. This raises the question as to whether immunosuppressed patients may have had a different benefit from steroids when compared with HIV-negative people or people living with HIV who are on ART. In the IMPI study, a supplemental analysis of only HIV-negative patients showed a small mortality benefit with steroid treatment. However, another smaller study of 58 subjects, all of whom were HIV-positive, found that steroids reduced mortality (56) . Other studies in the review did not address HIV and mortality.\n\nWith regard to the use of steroids in tuberculous pericarditis, in one study, an increase in HIV-related cancers (non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and Kaposi sarcoma) was observed (55) . However, this increase appeared to be caused by co-administration of immunotherapy ( M. indicus pranii ). The increase in cancers was not confirmed in another study (39) .

Diabetes was estimated to account for more than 10% of global TB deaths among HIV-negative individuals (61) .\n\nHyperglycaemia induces abnormalities in both the innate and adaptive immune response to M. tuberculosis , and diabetes increases the risk (twofold to fourfold) that TB infection will progress to disease; also, the response to treatment is often worse in those with diabetes. Among the mechanisms involved, bacterial recognition and phagocytosis are less effective in diabetes, with impairment of antigen-presenting cell recruitment and delay in activating the cellular immune response (62) . Clinically, this translates into an increased proportion of sputum smear positive patients, with more extensive pulmonary disease bilaterally, larger number of cavities and lymph node enlargement, and “atypical” findings of lower lobe lesions (especially in patients with poor glycaemic control). People with diabetes also suffer an increased rate of failure and death, and a higher risk of relapse (62) .\n\nDiabetes has a negative effect on the pharmacology of some anti-TB drugs (e.g. rifampicin), with higher risk of development of drug resistance (62) . Rifampicin is a potent hepatic enzyme inducer, increasing the hepatic metabolism of sulphonyl urea derivatives and therefore lowering their plasma levels. No effect of rifampicin is known on the exposure of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and only a slight effect on dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Although metformin is not metabolized by the P450 enzymes system, its hypoglycaemic effect may be increased by rifampicin, enhancing the expression of organic cation transporter and the hepatic uptake of metformin. Because insulin is not metabolized, no pharmacokinetic interactions with anti-TB drugs occur; therefore, some authors have recommended that it be used at the beginning of TB treatment, to achieve faster bacteriological sputum conversion and prevent DDIs (62) .\n\nA higher proportion and sometimes a greater severity of AEs has been described in TB patients with diabetes (e.g. peripheral neuropathy due to isoniazid and ocular neuropathy due to ethambutol) (62) .\n\nThere is evidence that the problems described above reduce when diabetes is well controlled. Therefore, adequate control of diabetes, and collaboration between TB and diabetes services, are important, particularly in countries with a high prevalence of diabetes.","tokens_est":675,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Treatment of DS-TB in special situations | 8.2 Pregnancy","content_type":"text","pages":"42-43","text":"8.2 Pregnancy\n\nEpidemiological information on TB in pregnancy is scarce. In the United Kingdom, women in early postpartum were twice as likely to develop TB as non-pregnant women (64) .\n\nA recent population study in Mozambique evaluated the prevalence of TB in pregnancy and found that it was similar to that of the general population, although it was higher in women living with HIV (65) . The TB prevalence was 505 (95% CI: 242–926) per 100 000 pregnant women and 297 (95% CI: 61–865) per 100 000 postpartum women. Among pregnant women who were HIV-positive, TB prevalence was 1626 per 100 000 (95% CI: 782–2970) and among postpartum women who were HIV-positive, TB prevalence was 984 per 100 000 (95% CI: 203–2848).\n\nIn addition to the TB-related risks to the mother, TB during pregnancy has been associated with high perinatal mortality, small size for gestational age, preterm and low birth weight neonates (66) . Maternal TB disease is associated with poorer neonatal outcomes, in part because of social deprivation and other factors that are associated with a higher risk of TB during pregnancy (67) . Disseminated TB in the mother can cause congenital TB in the infant, but this is a rare condition (68) . Diagnosis of TB is often delayed during pregnancy, because of its nonspecific symptoms and overlapping presentation with other infectious diseases. Adverse perinatal outcomes are even more pronounced in women with advanced disease, late diagnosis, and incomplete or irregular drug treatment. Many antenatal clinics are unprepared to diagnose TB (69) . Because pregnancy is usually considered an exclusion criterion, there is a lack of data from clinical trials including this important category of patients. Standard treatment for DS-TB is considered safe in pregnancy and outweighs the grave risks posed by untreated TB. Measurement of liver function before the start of treatment is useful and, if the function is found to be abnormal, appropriate management is undertaken (70, 71) . Core issues related to the management of treatment during pregnancy relate to the safety of the child before and after birth, considering both the risk of transmission (i.e. mother-to-child) and the potential teratogenic effect of anti-TB drugs.\n\nNeonatal TB is most commonly due to inhalation of tubercle bacilli. As long as the mother has received at least 2 weeks of treatment for DS-TB, isolation of the infant is not required (72) . This is particularly relevant because of the importance of breastfeeding for child health. Early diagnosis and treatment help to ensure the best possible outcome of TB in pregnancy for both mother and infant.\n\nPregnant women are usually treated with the standard 6-month 2HRZE/4HR regimen. Evidence on the use of the 4-month 2HPMZ/2HPM regimen during pregnancy is lacking (1) . Experts have suggested using pyridoxine to complement the anti-TB regimen in pregnancy, because deficiency is more likely to occur than in the general population (73) .","tokens_est":746,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Outbreaks in nursing homes are frequently described, particularly in countries with a low incidence of TB (76, 77) . The occurrence of TB among older people is also related to the higher prevalence of comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, chronic renal impairment and smoking) in this age group. The disability-adjusted life-years lost due to TB in patients aged over 65 years range from 8.2% in Europe to 18.7% in East and Central Asia (78) .\n\nThe main challenges to successful treatment among older patients include poor drug tolerance, AEs and poor treatment adherence, all of which could potentially lead to unfavourable treatment outcomes.\n\nRecent data from Japan on TB patients notified in 2017 indicate that the case-fatality rate increased with age, being 3.1% for those aged 0–64 years, 15.3% for those aged 65–74 years, 27.0% for those aged 75–84 years and finally 47.4% for those aged 85 years and over (44, 75) . A study in Nigeria described lower sputum smear conversion after the intensive phase of treatment in patients aged over 60 years, although only extrapulmonary TB and HIV coinfection were significant predictors of a poorer outcomes (73) .\n\nGastrointestinal upset and hepatitis are reported as the most frequent AEs in older people (79, 80) . In Japan, in patients aged 80 years or more treated for DS-TB with the 6-month regimen, the prevalence of hepatitis was higher among those receiving treatment with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol than among those receiving isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol, although treatment outcomes were similar in the two groups (81) .\n\nClinical attention should be paid to older patients undergoing pyrazinamide treatment, to rapidly identify and manage any AEs that eventually appear. Guidelines from the American Thoracic Society consider the option of excluding pyrazinamide in patients aged over 80 years (44) .\n\nEthambutol is excreted by the kidney. A low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (i.e. <30 mL/minute −1 ) has a poor prognosis in the treatment of TB (82) . In older people, the dose should be reduced according to the estimated GFR, but the time between doses should also be increased, to ensure that high blood levels of the drug do not persist (83) .\n\nOlder individuals are likely to have several comorbidities and are therefore likely to be taking other medicines; hence, there is potential for DDIs (84) . The interaction between the anticoagulant warfarin and rifampicin is especially problematic, and either heparin or a non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant are considerably safer. Other important interactions include those with statins, analgesics (e.g. celecoxib and losartan), oral antidiabetic medications, steroids, calcium channel blockers and theophyllines . When prescribing TB treatment in older people, it is always important to evaluate potential interactions among the different drugs prescribed to manage comorbidities (73) .\n\nAmong older people, particular care is also necessary to ensure correct adherence to the prescribed treatment within a multidisciplinary and patient- centred approach (44, 85) .","tokens_est":835,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

This has been attributed to increased host susceptibility from the cellular immunosuppressive effects of CRF and to social determinants of health among those with CRF (86) .\n\nThe severity of renal insufficiency is classified using creatinine clearance: it is mild when the rate of clearance is 60–120 mL/minute, moderate at 30–59 mL/minute, severe at 10–29 mL/minute and very severe at below 10 mL/minute. According to some experts, for patients with DS-TB on dialysis, a thrice-weekly dosing of pyrazinamide and ethambutol should be administered after the dialysis cycle (62, 86) . Creatinine clearance is calculated using the following formula:\n\nbody weight (kg) × (140 minus age in years) × 0.85 (in women) / 72 × creatinine value\n\nDose adjustments in adults with creatinine clearance below 30 mL/minute are as follows (unless otherwise indicated):\n\n• Pyrazinamide : 25–35 mg/kg per dose, three times per week after dialysis.\n\n• Ethambutol : 15–25 mg/kg per dose, three times per week after dialysis.\n\n• Rifapentine and moxifloxacin , which are both used in regimens for DS-TB, do not require renal dose adjustment (17, 87) .\n\nExperts recommend close monitoring of creatinine every week or every 2 weeks, and adequate hydration (71) . Given the frequent occurrence of electrolyte disturbances in CRF, weekly monitoring of electrolytes is also recommended.\n\nIn the case of severe hypokalaemia , treatment is with intravenous potassium chloride ( KCl ) at 10 mEq /hour −1 (10 mEq of KCl will raise the serum potassium by 0.1 mEq /L −1 ). If the potassium level is low, checking the magnesium is recommended by experts; if this is not possible, empirical treatment with magnesium (i.e. magnesium gluconate at 1000 mg twice daily) should be considered in all cases of hypokalaemia . The use of spironolactone, 25 mg daily, is suggested in refractory cases (71) .\n\nGiven the risk of QT prolongation (particularly due to moxifloxacin) and electrolyte imbalance, an ECG should be performed, taking into account that hypokalaemia may be refractory if the concurrent hypomagnesaemia is not corrected; the risk is higher if the intensive phase of treatment is prolonged for any reason; and electrolyte disturbances are reversible, although the disturbance might last weeks or months.","tokens_est":606,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

In the management of TB in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD), experts recommend monitoring aminotransferases (i.e. alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) on a weekly basis initially, and fortnightly after the second month of treatment. In cases where aminotransferase are five or more times higher than the upper limit of normal (with or without symptoms), or three or more times higher in the presence of symptoms or jaundice (i.e. bilirubin >3 mg/dL −1 ), the treatment should immediately be withdrawn. The responsible drugs should be identified, and a sequential reintroduction implemented once enzyme levels have returned to normal. The drug reintroduction should be performed one drug at a time, starting with the drug considered to be the least hepatotoxic, as follows:\n\n• when aminotransferases return to less than two times the upper limit of normal, rifampicin may be restarted with ethambutol;\n\n• after 3–7 days, after checking aminotransferases, isoniazid may be reintroduced, with subsequent rechecking of liver enzymes; and\n\n• if symptoms recur or aminotransferases increase again, the last drug added should be stopped and replaced with another from the list of the recommended drugs (71) .\n\nIf the clinical pattern indicates cholestasis, rifampicin may be the responsible drug. If the patient has prolonged or severe hepatotoxicity but tolerates isoniazid and rifampicin, a rechallenge with pyrazinamide may be hazardous. In this situation, pyrazinamide may be permanently discontinued, with treatment eventually extended to 9 months (71) . In patients with advanced CLD, coagulation factors should be carefully monitored (44, 88–90) .\n\nNTPs should consider stocking an extra supply of drugs to modify the HRZE regimen in the treatment of special situations such as CLD. Among the drugs that can be considered safe to use in patients with CLD are ethambutol and FQ (71) . Given their important bactericidal and sterilizing action, where possible, isoniazid or rifampicin (or both) should be included (71) .\n\nA patient’s N-acetyltransferase (NAT) status affects their risk profile. Slow acetylators have a higher possibility of liver injury, so an isoniazid dose of 2.5–5 mg/kg/day may be adequate in such patients; in rapid acetylators, in contrast, the isoniazid dose may be increased to 7.5 mg/kg/day.\n\nThe Child–Turcotte–Pugh (CTP) score is based on albumin, bilirubin, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR), ascites and encephalopathy.

Cough and sputum production can persist after sputum conversion in patients with extensive lung damage (often due to late diagnosis), but even in those with extensive lung damage, improvement is usually seen within 1–2 months of effective treatment. Persistent fever, weight loss or recurrence of any of the classic symptoms of TB should prompt investigation for possible treatment failure, undetected resistance to one or more drugs in the current treatment regimen or untreated comorbidities. The recurrence of TB symptoms after sputum conversion may be the first sign of treatment failure. For children, height and weight should be measured monthly to ensure that they are growing normally. Normal growth rate usually resumes after a few months of successful treatment. For adults, weight should also be recorded monthly (height is only recorded at the start of treatment, to calculate BMI).\n\nThe frequency of clinical visits depends on the patient’s clinical condition and evolution.

Specimen collection should not interrupt treatment, and specimens should be transported to the laboratory promptly; if a delay in transport is unavoidable, specimens should be refrigerated or kept as cool as possible.\n\nA positive sputum smear at the end of the second month may indicate any of the following:\n\n• even though the treatment response was good, non-viable bacteria remain present and are visible by microscopy;\n\n• resolution is slow because the patient had extensive cavitation and a heavy ini tial bacillary load (this often occurs in cases of late diagnosis );\n\n• a poor treatment response occurred for one of the following reasons:\n\n• the initial phase of therapy was poorly supervised and patient adherence was poor;\n\n• anti-TB drugs were of suboptimal quality;\n\n• doses of anti-TB drugs are below the recommended range;\n\n• the patient has comorbid conditions that interfere with either adherence or treatment response (e.g. diabetes or cancer );\n\n• the patient may have undetected DR-TB that is not responding to first-line treatment; or\n\n• although this is rare, the patient either does not absorb, or has suboptimal absorption of, one or more anti-TB drugs (74) .\n\nSputum culture can be used for treatment monitoring. Although monthly culture is recommended for MDR/RR-TB cases (17, 74, 93, 94) , this can also be useful for DS-TB, particularly at the end of the second month of treatment and at the end of treatment if the patient does not improve clinically, or at any other time if failure is suspected because of possible drug resistance. Where drug resistance is suspected, DST needs to be performed – the core of which is to test for resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin and moxifloxacin (if used) – and, if possible, to undertake DST using rapid tests for secondline drugs (92) .\n\nThe reasons behind a positive culture during treatment monitoring are the same as those mentioned above for sputum smear; however, a difference is that a positive culture indicates that viable bacilli are present.\n\nMolecular tests such as Xpert MTB/RIF are not used to monitor response to treatment.\n\nAlthough sputum smear is useful because of its much shorter turnaround time, sputum culture is much more sensitive for detection of ongoing active disease or treatment failure. Therefore, culture is useful to monitor the progress of treatment. Sputum smear and culture examinations depend on the quality of the sputum produced, so care should be taken to obtain adequate specimens and transport them to the laboratory according to standard procedures, to maintain the viability of the bacilli and thus obtain a valid culture result. A tracking system should be in place for all specimens sent for culture until results are obtained by the referring facility or clinician.","tokens_est":878,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

If a TB treatment regimen is not administered correctly, it may fail to deliver a relapse-free cure, thus increasing transmission and accelerating the emergence of drug resistance. Monitoring the effectiveness of TB treatment is thus critically important in both clinical practice and surveillance, to maximize the quality of individual patient care and the effectiveness of public health action. Hence, standardized TB treatment outcome definitions have been a feature of WHO policies and national TB surveillance systems for many years as a cornerstone of effective TB strategies. This standardization has allowed the monitoring of TB treatment outcomes over time at national and global levels.\n\nStandardized treatment outcome definitions for DS-TB have been in widespread use for more than 3 decades, and outcome definitions for DR-TB were first proposed in 2005 (96) . The development of DR-TB treatment outcome definitions was based on the outcome definitions for DS-TB in use at the time. The DR-TB treatment outcome definitions were adopted by WHO soon after and remained largely unchanged until 2013, when WHO updated its TB definitions and reporting framework (97) .

Post-treatment follow-up may be useful, when or if it is feasible, for patients suffering from post-treatment sequelae, for example (101) .\n\nThe new treatment outcome definitions are summarized in Table 1.10.1 .\n\nThe 2020 treatment outcome definitions allow all patients with either DS-TB or DR-TB to have a treatment outcome assigned when completing treatment (cure or treatment success) or when unfavourable events occur (e.g. loss to follow-up [LTFU], failure or death).\n\nAlthough the definitions of treatment outcomes have been harmonized, minor differences remain between those for DS-TB and DR-TB (e.g. treatment monitoring by sputum culture for DR-TB and by sputum smear microscopy for DS-TB).\n\nDespite some distinct treatment phases remaining in current regimens, the overall trend is towards monophasic regimens. Thus, it is best to avoid linking definitions to treatment phases; hence, the time thresholds for declaring cure or treatment failure have been revised.\n\nAlthough the role of new bacteriological tests was considered, treatment monitoring will continue to rely on the available tools (i.e. sputum culture for DR-TB and sputum microscopy for DS-TB), despite their limitations.","tokens_est":586,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

For this reason, the specific operational definition “sustained treatment success” was proposed ( Table 1.10.1 ), with the possibility of assessing numbers of patients alive and free of TB at 6 months (for DS-TB and DR-TB) and at 12 months (for DR-TB only) after successful TB treatment.","tokens_est":189,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Key considerations in DR-TB treatment | 3.1 Access to DST","content_type":"text","pages":"65-66","text":"3.1 Access to DST\n\nThe current guidelines for treatment of DR-TB stress the need for access to reliable, quality-assured DST, to be provided by NTPs and associated laboratories, to inform the use of the WHO-recommended regimens. Rapid molecular testing is making it increasingly feasible for NTPs to quickly detect MDR/ RR-TB and other types of resistance, and to use the results to guide treatment decisions (5, 6) . Hence, rapid molecular testing should be made available and accessible to ensure DST for at least rifampicin, isoniazid and FQ, given that DST for these drugs is essential for selecting the most appropriate initial DR-TB regimen. If the capacity for rapid molecular testing is lacking, NTPs should promptly build such capacity, and should make efforts to ensure universal access to all patients initiating a regimen for any form of TB, including both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant forms. To meet the End TB Strategy targets, DST for rifampicin and isoniazid should be offered to all TB patients, and all RR-TB patients should be offered DST for FQ. In addition, DST for the drugs used in the newly recommended regimens is increasingly important.\n\nIn addition to building capacity to ensure the routine performance of DST for medicines used in the clinical management of all patients, NTPs need to build surveillance systems to determine the local prevalence of DR-TB strains to guide programmatic planning. This is especially important for drugs for which resistance testing is not routinely performed or where the resistance prevalence of the drug is expected to be low initially (e.g. pretomanid ) and needs to be monitored over time. DRS can be based on data from routine diagnostic DST in TB patients (i.e. continuous surveillance) or from special surveys representative of the entire TB patient population (i.e. drug-resistance surveys) (7) . Data from local TB DRS may provide baseline estimates of the prevalence of resistance, including among relevant subgroups of recurrent and re-registered individuals with TB disease (e.g. recurrence or new episode of TB or return after LTFU). It can also provide monitoring trends to inform DST algorithms and inform broader local policy decisions (1, 8) .\n\nWHO recommends using WHO-recommended rapid diagnostics (WRD) as the initial tests to diagnose TB. The WRDs for the initial detection of TB (with or without drug resistance detection) include four classes of tests:\n\n– low-complexity manual nucleic acid amplification tests (LC- mNAATs );\n\n– urinary biomarker-based lateral flow LAM (LF-LAM) tests;\n\n– low-complexity automated NAATs (LC- aNAATs ) and\n\n– moderate-complexity automated NAATs (MC- aNAATs ).\n\nCurrently, only one test – loop-mediated isothermal amplification for detection of Mtb (TB LAMP) – is included in the class of LC- mNAATs , and the sole test – Determine TB LAM Ag – is included in the LF-LAM class, with neither test capable of detecting drug resistance. The class of LC- aNAATs for detection of TB and drug resistance includes the Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, Truenat MTB Plus and MTB-RIF Dx tests. These tests detect the Mtb complex and resistance to rifampicin. The class of MC- aNAATs includes multiple tests produced by a range of manufacturers (Abbott, BD, Bruker / Hain Lifesciences, and Roche) that are used as initial tests to detect Mtb complex and resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid. This class of tests is suitable for intermediate to central laboratories due to their infrastructural requirements. However, the initiation of a pertinent TB treatment regimen should not be delayed while waiting for DST results; hence, it is critical to ensure access to WRDs for the initial detection of TB at all levels of the health care system, either through onsite testing or through a functional sample transportation system.","tokens_est":956,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

The MC- aNAATs provide this result upfront but follow-on molecular tests recommended by WHO (i.e. Xpert MTB/XDR, line probe assay [LPA] and targeted next-generation sequencing [NGS]) can detect resistance to isoniazid, FQ, pyrazinamide, ethionamide and injectable drugs. Except for the first-in-class of the follow-on LC- aNAATs – the Xpert MTB/XDR that detects resistance to isoniazid, FQ, ethionamide and injectable drugs – the follow-on tests are more complex and require specialized infrastructure, qualified staff, biosafety conditions and a wellfunctioning sample transportation system. The first-line LPA detects resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid, the second-line LPA detects resistance to FQ and injectable drugs, and the first-in-class test of high-complexity hybridization NAATs detects resistance to pyrazinamide. The limited availability of LC- aNAATs and MC- aNAATs makes routine isoniazid resistance testing challenging in many settings.\n\nThe follow-on class of targeted NGS can detect resistance to rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, FQ, bedaquiline, linezolid, clofazimine, amikacin and streptomycin. Tese technologies are best suited for use at the reference laboratory level. Targeted NGS can provide DST results in a few days, excluding sample transportation and reporting (9) .\n\nThe interpretation of the results of molecular DST may be complex and it includes multiple steps. For resistance to isoniazid, mutations in two genes ( inh A and kat G ) are interrogated . If a mutation is present only in inh A , it is likely that isoniazid can still be effective at a high dose, whereas a mutation in kat G alone or mutations in both inh A and kat G render isoniazid no longer effective, even at a high dose (10) . For many anti-TB drugs, only selected mutations are known or can be detected by molecular tests; thus, depending on the type of the test, risk of resistance in a particular patient and result, the use of culture-based DST may still be needed. This would apply in the case of a negative LPA result for isoniazid, FQ or injectable drug resistance, especially if prevalence of resistance to these drugs is high or resistance is suspected in a particular patient. Similarly, in the case of negative result for resistance to bedaquiline, linezolid and clofazimine by targeted NGS and a high risk of resistance to these drugs in a particular setting or patient, the use of culture-based DST may still be needed. Further details on diagnostic tests recommended can be found in the relevant WHO consolidated guidelines (9) and operational handbook (11) in Module 3: Diagnosis – rapid diagnostics for tuberculosis detection .","tokens_est":711,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Key considerations in DR-TB treatment | 3.1 Access to DST","content_type":"text","pages":"66-67","text":"3.1 Access to DST (cont)\n\nCountry programmes need to work towards the establishment of phenotypic DST for all TB medicines for which there are now agreed reliable and reproducible methods (e.g. bedaquiline, clofazimine, delamanid, FQ, isoniazid, linezolid and rifampicin). The critical concentrations for various drugs were either established for the first time (bedaquiline, clofazimine, delamanid, linezolid, pretomanid and cycloserine ) (12) or revised (rifampicin and FQ) in WHO technical consultations (13) . Resistance to ethionamide/ prothionamide may be inferred from the results of molecular testing for isoniazid resistance (i.e. presence of mutations in the inh A promotor region) using either automated or manual molecular tests. However, susceptibility to ethionamide/ prothionamide cannot be inferred purely on the basis of the absence of a mutation in the inh A promotor gene using commercially available NAATs, because resistance can be conferred by other mutations in the inh A gene and its promotor and by mutations in the eth A gene that are not detected by these NAATs. A standardized phenotypic DST method using the mycobacterial growth indicator tube (MGIT) liquid culture automated system has been recently developed for pretomanid and cycloserine . Critical concentrations for pretomanid and cycloserine are included in the third edition of the operational handbook in Module 3: Diagnosis – rapid diagnostics for tuberculosis detection . Phenotypic DST for ethambutol, ethionamide/ prothionamide , imipenem/meropenem or p - aminosalicylic acid is not routinely recommended because results may be unreliable (10) .\n\nThe inability to undertake DST routinely in all patients despite all possible efforts should not be a barrier to starting patients on a potentially life-saving MDR-TB regimen; however, treatment should always be considered in a context of the potential risk of prescribing ineffective treatment and amplifying drug resistance, with a subsequent decrease in the likelihood of treatment effectiveness. If DST for bedaquiline and linezolid is not yet available, the clinician or the TB programme manager needs to estimate the likelihood of effectiveness of the medicines used, informed by the patient’s history of use of TB medicines, the drug-resistance pattern of the contact or source case, and recent representative DRS data. A reliable clinical history of exposure to bedaquiline and linezolid should thus be considered when designing a treatment regimen; however, this should be the main source of evidence to guide regimen design only in situations where phenotypic DST is not yet available. For paediatric patients, it is not always possible to obtain a DST result, owing to the difficulty of obtaining an adequate specimen or the lack of bacteriological confirmation; hence, the treatment regimen design should be based on the drug-resistance pattern of the index case. In the absence of individual DST, relevant population surveillance data are essential to inform the choice and design of MDR-TB treatment regimens. In addition to TB DRS findings, it is important for practitioners to know which medicines have been in frequent use in each geographical setting or patient groups . If DST is not routinely available for individual patients where there is treatment failure, storage of Mtb isolates collected at baseline or during treatment monitoring can be considered for performing phenotypic DST or whole genome sequencing at reference laboratories.\n\nThe adoption and implementation of a new regimen can and should proceed while the DST capacity is being established.","tokens_est":904,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Health care providers must offer careful clinical and bacteriological follow-up to assess the TB treatment response, with general laboratory support to monitor and manage AEs and comorbidities. The provision of social support is essential to enable adherence to treatment (15) . Certain programmatic components (e.g. aDSM ) (15, 16) are recommended for all patients on any MDR/RR-TB regimen ( Annex 3 ). An appropriate schedule of laboratory tests and clinical examinations should be included in the patient’s treatment chart to identify AEs (15) . In settings where aDSM has not yet been fully rolled out and national guidelines have not been updated, patients should not be left to wait until all programme components are fully in place before they can receive potentially life-saving interventions.

Key factors that influence the choice of treatment regimen include the drug-resistance profile, previous exposure to TB medicines, the patient’s health history, the drug-resistance profile of close contacts, the patient’s age and preferences, pregnancy status and the extent and localization of TB disease: pulmonary or extrapulmonary, with central nervous system (CNS) involvement or disseminated. The overall preference is for shorter, safer, better tolerable and more effective treatment regimens.\n\nThe evidence suggests that the balance of effects probably favours shorter and simpler regimens when compared with the standard of care (SoC); that is, 9-month or longer regimens . However, in cases of confirmed or presumed severe forms of extrapulmonary DR-TB (e.g. those with CNS involvement or dissemination to multiple organ systems) the treatment approach may require clinical judgement by an experienced specialist. These cases often necessitate longer regimens, inpatient care and, where there is CNS involvement, the inclusion of additional medicines with demonstrated efficacy in penetrating the blood–brain barrier. Among other considerations, the choice of regimen should be carefully tailored to the patient’s clinical condition and the extent of disease dissemination, ensuring optimal treatment outcomes.\n\nA shorter duration of treatment is preferred by patients and presents several advantages. For example, it decreases the risk of LTFU; is less of a burden on the patient, their household and the health system; and minimizes health care costs and unemployment stress.\n\nAmong available options, 6-month regimens are preferred over the 9-month or 18–20-month regimens, and 9-month regimens are preferred over the 18–20-month regimens.\n\n• The 6-month BPaLM regimen (6 Bdq -Pa- Lzd - Mfx ) (The regimen notations used throughout this document highlight the number of months for which a relevant combination of medicines is used; where certain drugs are used for a different duration, this is also noted, using subscript in brackets.) – comprising bedaquiline, pretomanid , linezolid and moxifloxacin – is a preferred regimen for adults and adolescents aged 14 years and older and is recommended for patients with MDR/RR-TB or pre-extensively drug-resistant TB ( preXDR -TB). Patients with unknown FQ resistance can be initiated on the BPaLM regimen while waiting for DST results. In cases where resistance to FQ (pre-XDR-TB) is identified before or after initiation of treatment, moxifloxacin can be omitted and the BPaL regimen can be initiated or continued, because there is probably no added benefit of using a drug with demonstrated resistance that may have toxicities. The duration of the BPaLM regimen is largely standardized for 6 months (26 weeks), whereas BPaL can be extended to a total of 9 months (39 weeks). It is suitable for people with confirmed pulmonary TB and all forms of extrapulmonary TB, except for cases involving the CNS , osteoarticular TB and disseminated (miliary) TB.

This regimen should be the initial choice for all eligible patients diagnosed with MDR/RR-TB. The recommendation in the updated WHO guidelines states:\n\nRecommendation 1.1: WHO suggests the use of a 6-month treatment regimen composed of bedaquiline, pretomanid , linezolid (600 mg) and moxifloxacin ( BPaLM ) rather than the 9-month or longer (18-month) regimens in MDR/RR-TB patients.\n\n(Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)\n\nRemarks\n\n1. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) for fluoroquinolones is strongly encouraged in people with MDR/ RR-TB, and although it should not delay initiation of the BPaLM , results of the test should guide the decision on whether moxifloxacin can be retained or should be dropped from the regimen – in cases of documented resistance to fluoroquinolones, BPaL without moxifloxacin would be initiated or continued.\n\n2. This recommendation applies to the following:\n\n‒ People with MDR/RR-TB or with MDR/RR-TB and resistance to fluoroquinolones (pre-XDR-TB).\n\n‒ People with confirmed pulmonary TB and all forms of extrapulmonary TB except for TB involving the CNS, osteoarticular or disseminated forms of TB with multiorgan involvement.\n\n‒ Adults and adolescents aged 14 years and older.\n\n‒ All people regardless of HIV status.\n\n‒ Patients with less than 1-month previous exposure to bedaquiline, linezolid, pretomanid or delamanid. When exposure is greater than 1 month, these patients may still receive these regimens if resistance to the specific medicines with such exposure has been ruled out.\n\n3. This recommendation does not apply to pregnant and breastfeeding women owing to limited evidence on the safety of pretomanid .\n\n4. The recommended dose of linezolid is 600 mg once daily, both for the BPaLM and the BPaL regimen. (Dosages of the other drugs are given in Table 2.4.1 .)\n\nThe BPaL regimen (bedaquiline, pretomanid , and linezolid) was first evaluated in the Nix-TB study (2015–2017, South Africa), which assessed its safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics for treating MDR/RR-TB, pre-XDR-TB, and patients who were intolerant or non-responsive to prior treatments. Based on promising results, the WHO recommended BPaL in 2019 under operational research conditions for MDR-TB patients with fluoroquinolone resistance and limited prior exposure to bedaquiline and linezolid.\n\nSubsequent trials, including TB-PRACTECAL and ZeNix , further investigated BPaL -based regimens, leading to the WHO’s 2022 treatment guideline update. The TB-PRACTECAL trial was a Phase 2–3, openlabel randomized controlled trial involving 419 patients across Belarus, South Africa, and Uzbekistan. Conducted by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), the trial compared three BPaL -based regimens (including BPaLM and BPaLC ) against the locally approved standard of care (SoC), which was based on WHO recommendations at the time. Meanwhile, the ZeNix trial focused on optimizing linezolid dosing to improve safety and efficacy.\n\nThe work leading to the WHO’s 2022 guideline update analyzed data from these trials on several BPaL based regimens and compared them to standard-of-care treatments and large MDR/RR-TB cohorts from South Africa and other countries. The BPaLM regimen demonstrated the highest treatment success rate (89%) in the TB-PRACTECAL trial, significantly outperforming standard regimens, which had success rates ranging from 52% to 75%. These findings solidified BPaL -based regimens as a transformative option for treating drug-resistant TB (19) .","tokens_est":953,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

In cases of possible FQ resistance (e.g. a history of >4 weeks of FQ use or close contact with a person infected with an FQ-resistant strain), it is best to initiate the BPaLM regimen until DST for FQ is available, to decide whether moxifloxacin should be continued, with moxifloxacin subsequently being dropped from the regimen if FQ resistance is confirmed. If the result of FQ DST is never determined or is not done, the BPaLM regimen should be used throughout. In cases of documented resistance to FQ, BPaL without moxifloxacin should be initiated or continued. If FQ resistance develops while an individual is receiving the BPaLM regimen but susceptibility to other drugs in this regimen is confirmed, moxifloxacin can be discontinued. In this scenario, BPaL can be continued because there is no benefit in retaining an ineffective drug that may cause toxicities.\n\nSeveral groups of patients, as described below, were excluded from the ZeNix and TB-PRACTECAL trials. Because no data about the safety of BPaLM / BPaL in those groups are available, the inclusion of such patients should be considered with caution. The exclusions are relative, and interventions may be taken to address the underlying conditions. Once those conditions have improved or resolved, such patients can be started on BPaLM / BPaL . In some cases, the underlying condition can be managed effectively. For instance, individuals with iron deficiency anaemia and haemoglobin (Hb) levels of less than 8 g/dL can receive iron supplementation. Once Hb rises above 8 g/dL, the BPaLM / BPaL can be initiated with close monitoring and weekly complete blood count. Similarly, QT prolongation of 500 ms due to hypokalaemia can be improved by correcting potassium levels, helping to normalize the QTcF .\n\nThe following conditions should be assessed, and appropriate precautions taken:\n\n• Patients with a very low BMI (<17 kg/m 2 ) should be monitored closely. Although the ZeNix -TB trial excluded those with a BMI of less than 17 kg/m 2 , TB-PRACTECAL had no such exclusion criterion and 167 (40%) of those in TB-PRACTECAL had a BMI of less than 17 kg/m 2 . Low BMI should not be an absolute contraindication when commencing the BPaLM / BPaL regimen. In the multicountry operational research study, a cohort of 71 individuals with a BMI lower than 17 kg/m² enrolled in the BPaL regimen achieved a success rate of 94% (21) .","tokens_est":906,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Alternatively, to decrease the risk of peripheral neuropathy exacerbation, a 9-month linezolid-sparing regimen could be used.\n\n• Linezolid is also associated with anaemia , neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, and caution is advised in patients with these conditions, particularly in those with a Hb level of less than 8 g/dL, a neutrophil count of less than 750/mm 3 or a platelet count of less than 150 000/mm 3 (See Annex 2 ).\n\n• Patients with liver enzymes at levels three times greater than the upper limit of normal were excluded from both the ZeNix and TB-PRACTECAL trials, because bedaquiline and pretomanid are both associated with increases in liver enzymes.

Both bedaquiline and moxifloxacin can prolong QT interval . While reports of serious AEs and mortality associated with QTc prolongation are rare, caution is strongly advised.\n\nWhere patients are moribund or have advanced TB disease, symptom control and palliative care may be more appropriate than initiation of treatment.

For BPaL , the GDG suggested the possibility of an extension to a total of 9 months (39 weeks) if no culture conversion or clinical response by month 4 ( Fig. 2.4.1 ). All medicines in the regimen would be used throughout the treatment, including the extension from 26 to 39 weeks (when BPaL is used). Ideally, missing doses of all three or four drugs in the regimen should be avoided; however, if doses are missed, any interruption of longer than 7 days should be made up for by extending the treatment duration (for the number of missed doses); therefore, 26 or 39 weeks of prescribed doses should be completed within an overall period of 7 or 10 months, respectively.\n\nPatients with susceptibility to FQ can be started on the BPaLM regimen for 6 months (26 weeks). In the case of resistance to FQ at the baseline that is identified after treatment initiation, moxifloxacin may be discontinued and the regimen can be continued as BPaL . When the regimen is BPaL from the start or is changed to BPaL , it can also be extended to a total of 9 months (39 weeks), continuing from the start of the therapy with a BPaL -based regimen. This extension of the BPaL regimen would be needed only in cases where there is a lack of culture conversion or clinical response (based on the radiological response and clinical judgement of the treating physician) by month 4. Close monitoring of treatment response is necessary for patients needing treatment extension. Once a decision has been made to extend treatment beyond 6 months, further sputum culture results must be followed up, to ensure that culture conversion occurs soon after month 4 on treatment. If the month 5 and 6 culture results remain persistently positive, treatment failure should be suspected, particularly if the patient has had suboptimal adherence to treatment or shows other signs of poor clinical or radiological response to treatment. This includes conducting DST to detect any acquired drug resistance to the component medicines. Extension of BPaL to 9 months should be undertaken with caution in patients with a high number of missed linezolid dosages – switching to an individualized longer regimen may be considered instead of a BPaL extension.\n\nFor individuals who switch from BPaLM to BPaL , the treatment start date should be considered as the date BPaLM was initiated, because the patient remained on treatment with three effective drugs during the entire treatment period.","tokens_est":692,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Although it is preferred to continue linezolid at the full dose for the entire duration, the dose may need to be reduced to 300 mg or discontinued (and restarted when possible) if there is significant toxicity.\n\nLinezolid is associated with myelosuppression ( anaemia , neutropenia and thrombocytopenia), with peripheral neuropathy and optic neuropathy, and the AEs were noted more frequently in regimens using high-dose linezolid (1200 mg daily). In the ZeNix study, 31% (14/45) of participants in the study arm using linezolid 1200 mg daily for up to 26 weeks experienced an AE of Grade 3 or more compared with 20% (9/45) of participants in the intervention arm using 600 mg daily of linezolid for 26 weeks, and 19.6% (20/102) of participants in the BPaL arm using linezolid 600 mg or 300 mg daily in the TB-PRACTECAL trial. In the multicountry BPaL operational research study, AEs of Grade 3 or higher were noted in 25.3% (75/297) of participants among those started with linezolid 1200 mg per day and 9.4% (5/53) among those started with linezolid 600 mg per day (21) .\n\nThe most common AEs resulting in dose modifications or early interruption of linezolid in the Nix-TB study (1200 mg dose of linezolid used) were peripheral neuropathy (81%) and myelosuppression (48%), but these AEs were often not severe and they improved with dose reductions or cessation of the drug. A toxicodynamic modelling study using Nix-TB data showed lower percentages of patients with severe peripheral neuropathy (median 5% versus 19%) and severe anaemia (1% versus 15%) in patients using 600 mg daily compared with 1200 mg linezolid daily (27) . Hence, care should be taken for patients who have an Hb level of less than 8 g/dL or a platelet count of less than 150 000/mm 3 .\n\nMyelosuppression (even of Grade 3 or 4) is often reversible with a short (e.g. 1-to-2-week) break from linezolid followed by resumption of the drug at a reduced dose of 300 mg per day, if needed, or to 600 mg per day, as tolerated; severe anaemia may need to be treated with blood transfusion.\n\nAlthough optic neuritis was infrequent, it is an important AE that can result in the permanent discontinuation of linezolid. In the Nix-TB study, two patients had optic neuritis during the fourth or fifth month of the BPaL regimen using 1200 mg per day, and symptoms resolved in both patients after permanent discontinuation of the regimen. In the LIFT-TB study, optic neuritis occurred in two patients given 600 mg of linezolid per day, and both improved and resolved after discontinuation.\n\nIn the ZeNix and TB-PRACTECAL trials, more than 90% of participants were able to complete more than 75% of the maximal intended dose and duration of linezolid. In the multicountry operational research study, in the 600 mg daily dose group ( n =53), 25% had linezolid dose modification due to AE (6 patients with linezolid dose reduction, 2 with interruption and 5 with permanent discontinuation). Despite these modifications, treatment success was 84.6% (1 person died and 1 was not evaluated) (21) .\n\nActions should be taken either before starting treatment or during treatment with BPaL -based regimens to address the common toxicities associated with linezolid.

After 9 weeks of consecutive administration of 600 mg of linezolid per day, the dose of linezolid can be reduced to 300 mg, if necessary (see examples in Box 2.4.2 ) or the drug may be ceased for 1–2 weeks.\n\nPharmacokinetic studies have suggested that dose optimization of linezolid may differ among patients (28) . Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a novel approach that can be used, where available, to optimize linezolid dose and minimize AEs, without compromising effectiveness (29) .\n\nFurther research is encouraged and is ongoing, to help ascertain how to optimize TDM in the treatment of individuals with MDR/RR-TB who are prescribed linezolid.\n\nThe findings from a dosing strategy study evaluating Nix-TB study data suggested that monitoring neuropathy symptoms and Hb levels may help to guide linezolid dosing to avoid toxicities. A decrease in Hb level of 10% or more after 4 weeks of treatment may help to identify those at high risk for severe anaemia (27) . However, further research on dosing strategies is needed to optimize when and how to reduce the dose of linezolid.","tokens_est":481,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

In such scenarios, the bedaquiline dosing schedule from the BPaLM regimen may be carried over into the BDLLfxC regimen to prevent excessively prolonged treatment durations that could arise from adding the full duration of the new regimen.

These patients were eligible to enrol in the ZeNix trial if they had a CD4 count of more than 100 cells/mm 3 , and in TB-PRACTECAL regardless of CD4 count. Thus, patients can be enrolled in the BPaLM / BPaL regimen irrespective of the CD4 count; however, care should be taken when CD4 counts are below 100 cells/mm 3 . In the LIFT-TB study, 14 patients had PLHIV, of whom 13 received linezolid 1200 mg daily. Treatment success was 92.9% (13/14); only one patient who was given 1200 mg per day failed treatment.\n\nIn the ZeNix trial, enrolled participants had to be taking permitted ARV medications. The permitted antiretroviral treatments were nevirapine in combination with tenofovir/abacavir or emtricitabine/lamivudine; lopinavir/ ritonavir in combination with tenofovir/abacavir or emtricitabine/lamivudine; and integrase inhibitor in combination with tenofovir/ abacavir or emtricitabine/lamivudine. For patients on efavirenz, therapy could be changed to rilpivirine with tenofovir/abacavir or emtricitabine/lamivudine. Although there was no such criterion in TB-PRACTECAL, it is important to consider DDIs when administering TB and HIV medications in combination (see Section 4.1.1). The ARV drug efavirenz induces the metabolism of bedaquiline, so its co-administration with bedaquiline may result in reduced bedaquiline exposure and loss of activity; therefore, co-administration is to be avoided. Efavirenz also reduces pretomanid exposures significantly (31) ; therefore, an alternative ARV agent (potentially dolutegravir, although there is currently insufficient evidence for this) should be used if the BPaLM / BPaL regimen is considered. Ritonavir increases bedaquiline exposure, which could potentially increase the risk of bedaquilinerelated adverse reactions (32) ; however, increased risk has not been noted in studies administering both drugs concurrently (32–34) , including in the ZeNix trial. Individuals who are prescribed both bedaquiline and ritonavir should be monitored closely for AEs, including QTc prolongation. Finally, ARV regimens including zidovudine should be avoided, if possible, because both zidovudine and linezolid may cause myelosuppression (more details in Annex 2 ).","tokens_est":598,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

A WHO-recommended rapid molecular test should be used as an initial rapid test (in preference to culture and phenotypic DST) to detect resistance to FQ (35) . The results of the DST, when available, should guide the decision on the use or changes of this regimen; however, initiation of the BPaLM regimen should not be delayed by the wait for these results.\n\nFor patients who submit a sputum sample for culture-based second-line DST at the beginning of treatment, results may not be available until after treatment has started. If resistance to any of the regimen component drugs (except moxifloxacin) is discovered after treatment has been initiated, the regimen needs to be discontinued. Although DST for bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid is not easily accessible, in situations where it is available, it is highly desirable to carry this out at baseline. Patients with strains resistant to bedaquiline, pretomanid or linezolid should commence treatment with either a 9-month regimen or a longer, individualized MDR-TB regimen.\n\nIt is critical to know the resistance profile of the patient and thus exclude resistance to the anti-TB drugs composing the BPaLM / BPaL regimen. Molecular (genotypic) methods have considerable advantages, in particular with regard to their speed, the standardization of testing, their potentially high throughput and the reduced requirements for biosafety.\n\nMany different rapid molecular DST methods are available for moxifloxacin (LPA, LC- aNAATs and targeted NGS). If resistance to moxifloxacin is detected, then moxifloxacin should be discontinued and the patient should be continued with the BPaL regimen.\n\nOnly one molecular method, targeted NGS, is available to detect resistance to bedaquiline and linezolid; where this method is available, it should be performed before the start of the BPaLM / BPaL regimen. The results of targeted NGS for bedaquiline and linezolid should be critically assessed, taking into account the prevalence of resistance to these drugs in tested populations and the risk of resistance in a particular patient.\n\nCertain individuals are at high risk for resistance to bedaquiline and linezolid; for example, people with prior drug exposure, populations where the prevalence of resistance is above 5% and those with a history of contact with a person with TB with known drug resistance. For such individuals, a negative (sensitive) result of the targeted NGS phenotypic testing is advised. In addition, if resistance to bedaquiline is detected (in cases of low or high risk of this resistance in particular patients), the use of the phenotypic DST is still advised.\n\nFinally, the critical concentrations for pretomanid phenotypic resistance detection have been established for the MGIT method, enabling NTPs to perform phenotypic DST.\n\nIf resistance to bedaquiline, pretomanid or linezolid is detected in patients with MDR/RR-TB, the BPaLM / BPaL regimen should not be offered, and the patient must switch to another appropriate treatment regimen.\n\nIf resistance to bedaquiline, linezolid or pretomanid develops while on the regimen, the treatment is considered to have failed, and individuals should be shifted to either a 9-month regimen or a longer individualized regimen ( Sections 5 and 6 ).\n\nIn the absence of DST for bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid, treatment decisions will rely on the likelihood of effectiveness of these medicines, based on an individual patient’s clinical history of exposure to the drugs and DRS data from the country or region. This should be considered an interim measure until the DST capacity for these drugs becomes available.","tokens_est":936,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

This short regimen is particularly appropriate for people who are unable to benefit from the currently recommended 6-month BPaLM regimen owing, for example, to restricted access to pretomanid , being aged younger than 14 years, or being pregnant or breastfeeding. The recommendation in the updated 2025 guideline states:\n\nRecommendation 1.2 (NEW): WHO suggests the use of a 6-month treatment regimen composed of bedaquiline, delamanid, linezolid (600 mg), levofloxacin, and clofazimine ( BDLLfxC ) in MDR/RR-TB patients with or without fluoroquinolone resistance. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)\n\nRemarks\n\n1. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) for fluoroquinolones is strongly encouraged in people with MDR/ RR-TB. Although it should not delay the initiation of the BDLLfxC , the test results should guide the decision on whether levofloxacin or clofazimine should be retained.\n\n2. This recommendation applies to the following:\n\na) People with MDR/RR-TB or pre-XDR-TB (i.e. MDR/RR-TB and resistance to fluoroquinolones).\n\nb) Patients with less than 1 month of previous exposure to bedaquiline, linezolid, delamanid or clofazimine. When exposure is greater than 1 month, these patients may still receive the regimen if resistance to the specific medicines involved in such exposure has been ruled out.\n\nc) People with diagnosed pulmonary TB of all ages, including children, adolescents, PLHIV, and pregnant and breastfeeding women.\n\nd) People with all forms of extrapulmonary TB except for TB involving the CNS, osteoarticular TB, or disseminated forms of TB with multiorgan involvement.\n\ne) Children and adolescents who do not have bacteriological confirmation of TB or resistance patterns but who do have a high likelihood of MDR/RR-TB (based on clinical signs and symptoms of TB, in combination with a history of contact with a patient with confirmed MDR/RR-TB).\n\n3. When resistance to fluoroquinolones is unknown, the regimen should be started as BDLLfxC and then adjusted based on the DST results. In cases of quinolone susceptibility, clofazimine should be dropped and the regimen started or continued as bedaquiline, delamanid, linezolid and levofloxacin ( BDLLfx ). In cases of resistance to fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin should be dropped and the regimen started or continued as bedaquiline, delamanid, linezolid and clofazimine (BDLC).","tokens_est":663,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

This was a pragmatic, open-label, RCT conducted at two government health facilities in different provinces between August 2019 and September 2022. The trial used a non-inferiority design to compare safety and efficacy of the study strategy with the SoC approach in South Africa (44) . People presenting to the hospital sites for diagnosis and treatment of MDR/RR-TB were asked to give written informed consent for trial participation and were then randomized to the study strategy (6 months of bedaquiline, delamanid, linezolid and either levofloxacin or clofazimine, or both) or the control strategy (WHO-recommended, mostly 9-month all-oral, bedaquiline-containing regimen for FQ-susceptible TB and longer regimen for FQ-resistant TB patients). The study strategy used a “tapering down” approach, whereby participants diagnosed with TB that was resistant to at least rifampicin would initiate a regimen composed of bedaquiline, delamanid, linezolid, levofloxacin and clofazimine. Once FQ DST results became available, either immediately or later, the regimen was altered as follows: clofazimine was withdrawn (and levofloxacin continued) when FQ susceptibility was confirmed, levofloxacin was withdrawn (and clofazimine continued) when FQ resistance was confirmed, and neither drug was withdrawn (both levofloxacin and clofazimine continued) in cases where FQ DST results were unavailable. This tapering down approach made provision for the potential delay in obtaining FQ DST results while still allowing rapid initiation of effective MDR/RR-TB treatment, which provided adequate cover for both FQ-susceptible and FQ-resistant strains from the outset.\n\nThe evidence for the novel 6-month BDLLfxC regimen that was used to inform PICO questions for the updated WHO guidelines was derived from BEAT Tuberculosis RCT. However, an unrelated study with a similar name – the BEAT-India (Building Evidence to Advance Treatment of TB) study – was a prospective open-label, single-group cohort study that was carried out at five sites in India between April 2019 and January 2021 (45) . The BEAT-India study only enrolled patients with pre-XDR-TB, but the 6-month study regimen (BDLC) was the same as that used for participants with pre-XDR-TB enrolled in the study strategy of the BEAT Tuberculosis trial. Although not considered in the PICO questions for these guidelines, the encouraging findings from the BEAT-India study also appear to support the recommendations for implementation of a 6-month regimen containing these medicines in settings outside of South Africa.\n\nThe BEAT Tuberculosis trial enrolled 402 participants: 202 to the study strategy and 200 to the control strategy. Most participants in the control strategy received the WHO-recommended 9-month regimen containing bedaquiline and linezolid. The study protocol allowed for enrolment of PLHIV, children aged over 6 years, adolescents, and pregnant and breastfeeding women. Patients with extensive or severe pulmonary TB were also included, as were people with non-severe extrapulmonary forms.\n\nThe results of this RCT support the programmatic use of a 6-month regimen containing bedaquiline, delamanid and linezolid, as well as levofloxacin or clofazimine (or both), in place of 9-month or longer regimens in patients with MDR/RR-TB or pre-XDR-TB who are unable to receive pretomanid within the BPaL or BPaLM regimens.","tokens_est":930,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

If patients had extensive pulmonary disease, had slow clinical response to treatment or sputum culture conversion had not occurred by the fourth month (week 16) on treatment with any of the BDLLfxC regimen variations, the study protocol allowed for the full duration of the regimen to be extended by another 3 months, up to a total of 9 months (36 weeks) of treatment. A similar approach was taken in the BEAT-India study, where the BDLC regimen was extended by 12 weeks for patients with pre-XDR-TB if the week 16 sputum sample was culture positive (45) . There are three main reasons for delayed culture conversion. The first is an extensive pulmonary TB disease as assessed on CXR. If possible, the CXR taken at the start of treatment should be reviewed and compared with the one taken at month 4 in this case. The second reason is non-adherence to treatment. It is necessary to check on-time pharmacy pickups and to confirm with the patient and any treatment supporter that all doses have been taken. The last reason is that there is undiagnosed resistance to one of the drug components of the regimen. This could have been present at the time of starting therapy or acquired during treatment. Where possible, a specimen should be sent for DST for bedaquiline, linezolid and delamanid.\n\nIn practice, sputum culture results usually take up to 6 weeks to be reported as negative. Therefore, bacteriological culture conversion (i.e. two consecutive cultures from samples taken on different occasions at least 7 days apart are negative) might only be confirmed after 5 or 6 months on treatment, which is when the results of samples taken at months 3 or 4 would become available. In some situations, e.g., where the full DST results are not available or where a person’s symptoms are slow to improve, clinicians may use their discretion and choose to extend treatment to nine months for patients with extensive pulmonary disease. Once a decision has been made to extend treatment beyond 6 months, further sputum culture results must be followed up, to ensure that culture conversion occurs soon after month 4 on treatment.

For young children diagnosed with TB based on clinical criteria or for patients with extrapulmonary TB, this extension can be applied based on clinical assessment of the treatment response, while considering other potential causes for deterioration (e.g. undiagnosed resistance, poor adherence to therapy or other clinical factors). The absence of clinical improvement or culture conversion by month 6 should prompt a comprehensive evaluation of the treatment regimen to assess potential failure.","tokens_est":857,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Among the 402 participants in the BEAT Tuberculosis trial in South Africa, 10% experienced severe anaemia during their treatment course (see Annex 2 ). Of the 202 participants in the study strategy, 159 (79%) completed the entire 6-month course of treatment without interruptions. Eighteen participants (11%) had linezolid permanently discontinued during the 6-month treatment course owing to anaemia ( n =3), optic neuritis ( n =6) or peripheral neuropathy ( n =9). Patients initiating the BDLLfxC regimen should be supported to continue linezolid for at least the first 2 months (9 weeks) of treatment. Otherwise, an alternative regimen should be considered. Patients who experience severe AEs and have to stop linezolid beyond 2 months of treatment do not necessarily need to switch regimens, but this depends on the timing of drug withdrawal, the availability of other DST results and the patient’s clinical response to treatment. For example, if a patient with FQ-susceptible MDR/ RR-TB is responding well to treatment (bacteriologically and clinically) with BDLLfx but experiences a severe linezolid-related AE after 2 months of treatment, then linezolid could be withdrawn without having to switch regimens. See Annex 2 for further details on the management of linezolid toxicity.\n\nSevere AEs leading to withdrawal of other component drugs in the BDLLfxC regimen are rare, but permanent withdrawal of bedaquiline, delamanid or clofazimine would certainly necessitate changing to an alternative regimen. For example, if a patient’s QT interval exceeds 500 ms at any point throughout treatment, then all drugs should be withheld, and other causes of QT prolongation (electrolyte disturbances, other non-essential drugs) excluded and appropriately managed, until the QT interval is back below 500 ms. If at least four effective component drugs cannot be reintroduced without persistent QT-interval prolongation above 500 ms , then an alternative regimen must be considered.","tokens_est":556,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

In addition, co-administration of efavirenz with delamanid increases the risk of neuropsychiatric adverse effects. Therefore, alternative ARVs should be used with the BDLLfxC regimens – in the BEAT Tuberculosis trial, ART for PLHIV included either dolutegravir or a protease inhibitor.

Thirteen children were randomized to the study strategy group and all had bacteriologically confirmed MDR/RR-TB disease, of which 24% were FQ-resistant.\n\nMost of the children and adolescents enrolled on the BEAT Tuberculosis trial were aged above 12 years. Bacteriological confirmation of MDR/RR-TB disease in children aged below 12 years often signifies severe disease. The high rate of treatment success among children and adolescents in this trial is encouraging; it supports the efficacy of this regimen for children of all ages with severe and non-severe pulmonary MDR/RR-TB disease. In the absence of bacteriological confirmation of disease in younger children, the decision to treat for MDR/RR-TB relies on clinical signs and symptoms of TB disease, radiological findings, and history of significant exposure to a person with microbiologically confirmed MDR/RR-TB. In these cases, treatment decisions and regimen choice should be based on the drug-resistance pattern of the isolate obtained from the index case.\n\nDespite the small numbers of children included in the BEAT Tuberculosis trial, the evidence supporting the efficacy of this regimen in adults and adolescents may be extrapolated to children, provided the implementation considerations are followed. Therefore, children of all ages, with either severe or nonsevere pulmonary disease, as well as those with uncomplicated extrapulmonary disease (peripheral lymph nodes or isolated mediastinal mass without airways compression) are likely to benefit from the 6-month BDLLfxC regimen.\n\nAll the component drugs in the BDLLfxC regimens have already been used in various combinations to treat MDR/RR-TB in children, and drug dosages have been established (and continue to be refined) for children of all ages. Child-friendly, dispersible formulations exist for all the component drugs in the BDLLfxC regimens and are strongly preferred by children and their caregivers. TB programmes must prioritize procuring and providing these formulations for children with MDR/RR-TB. Although childfriendly formulations are the priority, the lack of these is not a barrier to providing children access to the BDLLfxC and other MDR/RR-TB regimens. Bedaquiline and delamanid tablets can be crushed and mixed in water for easier administration to young children without compromising the bioavailability of the drugs (in comparison to swallowing tablets whole), and linezolid is also available as a suspension for easier administration in children who are unable to swallow tablets.\n\nAlthough children tend to tolerate treatment better than adults, the AEs associated with secondline anti-TB drugs remain significant for children, especially as they may be unable to adequately verbalize or describe the symptoms they experience. This underscores why shorter regimens and those involving fewer drugs, such as the BDLLfxC regimen, are particularly favored for children.

Patients with TB often have anaemia of chronic disease, and iron deficiency is common in children with malnutrition. Pregnant women with TB are likely to be anaemic (for multiple reasons) before starting treatment. Therefore, pretreatment assessment of Hb, neutrophils and platelets is crucial in patients considering treatment with linezolid-based regimens. Children with a low baseline Hb are at risk of developing severe linezolid-induced haematological toxicity (50) . The 6-month BDLLfxC regimens may not be suitable for patients with a pretreatment serum Hb level below 8 g/dL. Blood transfusions can be beneficial in quickly correcting Hb levels before starting MDR/RR-TB treatment, enabling the initiation of linezolid. The acceptability and availability of blood transfusion in various settings must be taken into consideration and balanced alongside the risks and benefits of treating with shorter, linezolidcontaining regimens. Treatment with an effective MDR/RR-TB regimen (even including linezolid) usually leads to improvement or resolution of anaemia once the disease is properly treated and the patient’s appetite improves. Regular blood tests are necessary to monitor for linezolid-induced myelotoxicity; this may be challenging, especially in younger children, and health care providers could consider alternative feasible options for monitoring (e.g. rapid Hb tests on heelstick samples).\n\nBlood transfusions during treatment may or may not be helpful in situations where Hb drops significantly owing to linezolid toxicity. The effects of a blood transfusion to correct linezolid-induced anaemia are often transient if exposure to linezolid is ongoing; however, a transfusion might assist a patient in completing at least the first 2 months of linezolid and may also help to avoid the person having to switch to a longer regimen. Aside from blood transfusions, it may be possible to manage linezolid-induced anaemia by pausing the drug for short periods (7–14 days) or reducing the dose of linezolid (although this is not recommended in patients weighing over 50 kg). In the BEAT-India study, where adults with pre-XDR-TB were treated with the 6-month BDLC regimen, patients were initiated on linezolid at a dose of 600 mg once daily; 100 (60%) of the 165 patients in this cohort had a BMI of less than 18.5 kg/m 2 . The drug dose was reduced to 300 mg daily in 45 patients experiencing linezolidinduced severe AEs, following a temporary pause in linezolid dosing, and 40 of these 45 patients went on be cured of their disease. The approach to linezolid toxicity management in the BEAT Tuberculosis trial in South Africa, where 10% of participants receiving linezolid in the study strategy experienced severe anaemia (Hb <8 g/dL) (51) , was to withhold linezolid for a short period, rechallenge the drug at the same dose and transfuse the patient. Reduced doses of linezolid (<600 mg for adults) were not used in the BEAT Tuberculosis trial.\n\nOwing to the morbidity associated with severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, the 6-month BDLLfxC regimen is also not suitable in patients with neutrophil levels of less than 750/mm3 or platelets below 150 000/mm3 before starting treatment. However, because these parameters may change quickly, it is advisable to repeat them before making a decision on withholding BDLLfxC .","tokens_est":893,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

The QT-prolonging effects of these drugs are likely to be additive in adults with normal baseline QT-interval values, and although the combination of these three drugs may not necessarily result in clinically significant QT-interval prolongation beyond 500 ms , patients receiving the BDLC or BDLLfxC regimens will have less leeway for further QT-interval variation. Therefore, patients with a QT interval closer to 500 ms at baseline, or those with other risk factors for QT-interval prolongation (e.g. thyroid dysfunction, electrolyte disturbances, diabetes or concomitant use of other QT-prolonging medications) should be informed of their potentially higher risk of clinically significant QT-interval prolongation; such patients should receive closer ECG monitoring and have reversible causes of QT-interval prolongation corrected as soon as possible.

People receiving the BDLLfxC regimen must be supported using a person- centred approach to ensure full adherence to treatment. The principles of person- centred care and support for people with TB are outlined in Chapter 3 of this handbook. Specific adherence challenges should be identified early in treatment, and locally feasible strategies employed to support patients at home and in their communities to complete the full duration of treatment; patients with such challenges should also be given information on appropriate treatment administration options. Child-friendly formulations of all drugs in the BDLLfxC regimen are available and should be procured and provided to all children with MDR/RR-TB.\n\nEarly counselling for patients and their treatment supporters should include information on potential side-effects that patients may experience with the BDLLfxC drugs, particularly the neuropsychiatric effects of delamanid in children (which may be alarming for parents) as well as the skin discolouration with clofazimine (which parents may not necessarily be expecting in infants exposed in-utero or while breastfeeding). In addition, patients (and their caregivers) initiating the 6-month regimens should be counselled before or early in treatment about the consequences of interrupting the 6-month BDLLfxC regimens, because subsequent treatment options when they return to care are likely to be more challenging in terms of toxicity and duration of treatment.","tokens_est":475,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

The recommendation in the consolidated 2025 guidelines (1) states:\n\nRecommendation 2.1: WHO suggests the use of the 9-month all-oral regimen rather than longer (18-month) regimens in patients with MDR/RR-TB and in whom resistance to fluoroquinolones has been excluded.\n\n(Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)\n\nRemarks\n\n1. The 9-month all-oral regimen consists of bedaquiline (used for 6 months), in combination with levofloxacin/moxifloxacin, ethionamide, ethambutol, isoniazid (high-dose), pyrazinamide and clofazimine (for 4 months, with the possibility of extending to 6 months if the patient remains sputum smear positive at the end of 4 months), followed by treatment with levofloxacin/ moxifloxacin, clofazimine, ethambutol and pyrazinamide (for 5 months). Ethionamide can be replaced by 2 months of linezolid (600 mg daily).\n\n2. A 9-month regimen with linezolid instead of ethionamide may be used in pregnant women, unlike the regimen with ethionamide.\n\n3. This recommendation applies to:\n\na. people with MDR/RR-TB and without resistance to fluoroquinolones;\n\nb. patients without extensive TB disease and without severe extrapulmonary TB;\n\nc. patients with less than 1 month exposure to bedaquiline, fluoroquinolones, ethionamide, linezolid and clofazimine; when exposure is greater than 1 month, these patients may still receive this regimen if resistance to the specific medicines with such exposure has been ruled out;\n\nd. all people regardless of HIV status;\n\ne. children (and patients in other age groups) who do not have bacteriological confirmation of TB or resistance patterns but who do have a high likelihood of MDR/RR- TB (based on clinical signs and symptoms of TB, in combination with a history of contact with a patient with confirmed MDR/RR-TB).\n\nIn 2019, for the WHO guideline update, the South African Department of Health provided WHO with access to programmatic data on injectable-free regimens that had been used in South Africa since 2017, when most eligible patients were enrolled on a shorter regimen, with bedaquiline replacing the injectable. Since then, new data from patients receiving WHO-recommended shorter and longer MDR/RR-TB regimens have been incorporated into an individual patient dataset (IPD) in 2021; these data were presented to the GDG in 2022 to help inform the development of the updated WHO guidelines on DR-TB. In addition, routine data from the South African NTP were available to assess the 9-month all-oral regimen containing linezolid (600 mg daily) instead of ethionamide, for treatment of patients with FQ-susceptible MDR/RR-TB and without previous exposure to second-line TB drugs. The South African routine dataset of patients receiving the 9-month all-oral linezolid-containing regimen would also have excluded children aged below 6 years, as well as patients with extensive pulmonary TB disease and severe forms of extrapulmonary TB, because these patients were not considered eligible for this regimen under national DR-TB guidelines (52) . For the updated 2022 WHO guidelines, the 9-month linezolid-containing regimen used in South Africa was compared with the earlier dataset and the 2021 IPD from patients meeting the same eligibility criteria and who received the WHO-recommended 9-month all-oral regimen containing ethionamide instead of linezolid, or the longer regimens designed based on the 2020 WHO recommendations.","tokens_est":940,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

The certainty of evidence was judged to be very low. Based on this, the GDG judged that the balance of health effects does not favour either the 9-month regimen with linezolid or the 9-month regimen with ethionamide. Therefore, WHO has updated its conditional recommendation that, in eligible patients with MDR/RR-TB, the 9-month all-oral regimen may be used, and that 2 months of linezolid can be used as an alternative to 4 months of ethionamide within this shorter regimen (1).\n\nThe implementation of these two variations of the 9-month all-oral regimen (i.e. including either linezolid for 2 months or ethionamide for 4 months) is to provide more flexible and effective treatment options for MDR/RR-TB. This regimen still requires combined use of seven agents (some with considerable toxicity), most of which will be continued for at least 9 months. Patients will need support to overcome the hardships associated with TB and its treatment, including daily adherence challenges, adverse drug reactions, indirect costs and stigma.","tokens_est":326,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Several eligibility criteria must be considered for this regimen, with additional considerations for the use of linezolid instead of ethionamide.\n\nThe 9-month all-oral regimen (with either ethionamide or linezolid) may be offered to the following patients with MDR/RR-TB (where resistance to at least rifampicin has been confirmed and resistance to FQ has been ruled out):\n\n• those with no documented resistance or suspected ineffectiveness of bedaquiline, clofazimine, or ethionamide or linezolid (whichever is considered for inclusion in the regimen );\n\n• those with no exposure to previous treatment with bedaquiline, FQ (This includes exposure to FQs as either treatment or prevention of MDR/RR-TB) , clofazimine, or ethionamide or linezolid (whichever is considered for inclusion in the regimen) for more than 1 month – when prior drug exposure is greater than 1 month, patients may still receive this regimen if resistance to the specific medicine with such exposure has been ruled out;\n\n• those with no extensive or severe TB disease and no severe extrapulmonary TB;\n\n• all people living with or without HIV;\n\n• women who are pregnant or breastfeeding: and\n\n• children and adults without bacteriological confirmation of TB or resistance patterns but who require MDR/RR-TB treatment based on clinical signs and symptoms of TB (including radiological findings) and history of contact with someone with confirmed MDR/RR-TB: these patients may be eligible for this regimen based on the drug resistance profile of the isolate obtained from the most likely index case.\n\nLinezolid is associated with considerable toxicity, which necessitates close monitoring for signs of bone marrow suppression and neuropathies. Optic neuritis and peripheral neuropathies tend to be reported beyond 2 months of treatment with linezolid, whereas myelosuppression is significantly dose dependent and is more likely to occur during the first 2 months of exposure to the drug (53, 54) . Nevertheless, linezolid is far more effective than ethionamide and helps to maintain a relatively effective regimen, particularly in cases of MDR/RR-TB where phenotypic DST results are awaited to confirm FQ susceptibility. Therefore, the 9-month all-oral regimen containing linezolid (instead of ethionamide) should be offered wherever possible to patients who fulfil the eligibility criteria above, as well as the following:\n\n• serum Hb above 8 g/dL, neutrophils above 750 mm 3 and platelets above 150 000/mm 3 at the start of treatment; and\n\n• no evidence of severe peripheral neuropathy, or any sign or suspicion of optic neuritis, at the start of treatment.\n\nThe 9-month all-oral regimen with ethionamide instead of linezolid, or a longer regimen without linezolid, may be more appropriate options for patients with very low Hb, neutrophils or platelets, severe peripheral neuropathy or concerns regarding vision. Mild or moderate peripheral neuropathy (Grade 1 or 2) may also be sufficient reason to offer a 9-month regimen that uses ethionamide, based on the patient’s preference after discussing the risks and benefits of not including linezolid. However, the ethionamide-containing regimen must be avoided during pregnancy. The decision regarding which regimen offers the best option for cure in a patient may also depend on other considerations; for example, preferences of patients and clinicians, pill burden, drug formulations, regional DRS data, feasibility of monitoring for drug adverse effects, and availability of blood transfusion services or ophthalmology services, if required.","tokens_est":956,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

It is not advisable to change the composition of the regimen or the duration of either the initial or continuation phase, with a few exceptions, as follows:\n\n• Bedaquiline is usually given for 6 months but may be extended to 9 months if the initial phase of the regimen is extended from 4 to 6 months because of positive sputum smears at month 4 of treatment.\n\n• Linezolid is only given for 2 months (instead of 4–6 months of ethionamide). If occasional doses of linezolid are missed during that time, the missed doses can be added on to the end of the 2-month period if the patient is tolerating the drug well; however, once FQ resistance has been definitively ruled out, it may not be strictly necessary to make up the missed doses. The linezolid dose should not be reduced to less than the recommended dose to reduce the severity of adverse effects. If the full dose of linezolid (600 mg in adults) is not tolerated for the first full 2 months of treatment (apart from occasionally missed doses, which can be added to the end of the 2-month period), then the patient must either switch to an ethionamide-containing 9-month regimen (provided FQ susceptibility is confirmed and the patient is not pregnant) or to an individualized longer regimen without linezolid. In selected cases where the risk of undetected resistance to FQ and other secondline TB drugs is very low and the patient is unable to tolerate linezolid but would greatly benefit from a shorter regimen (e.g. migrant populations and children), the treating clinician may, after weighing up the risks and benefits, choose to stop linezolid before 2 months and continue the 9-month all-oral regimen, with close monitoring for relapse or recurrence.\n\n• Prothionamide may be used instead of ethionamide.\n\n• Moxifloxacin may be used instead of levofloxacin, provided close ECG monitoring is feasible (should this be required).\n\n• If, for any reason, a patient is unable to tolerate pyrazinamide or ethambutol within the 9-month regimen, then one (but only one) of these drugs may be dropped during the continuation phase without necessitating a switch to a longer regimen. If two or more of these drugs are not tolerated within the 9-month regimen, the treatment will have to switch to a longer regimen. If any of the other drugs within the 9-month regimen (bedaquiline, levofloxacin/moxifloxacin, linezolid/ ethionamide or clofazimine) are stopped early because of toxicity or intolerance then the patient will also have to switch to a new regimen. Patients switching to a new regimen due to toxicity or intolerance need to be reported as “treatment failed” ( Section 10, Chapter 1 ).\n\n• At the fourth month of treatment on the 9-month regimen, the decision to extend the initial phase from 4 to 6 months is based on the bacteriological sputum smear status of the patient’s sputum specimen. If the specimen is smear negative at month 4 (regardless of smear status at the start of treatment), the patient may move to the continuation phase of treatment. If the specimen is smear positive at month 4, the initial phase is prolonged to 6 months. The duration of the continuation phase remains fixed at 5 months.","tokens_est":823,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

In cases where an eligible patient starts the 9-month all-oral MDR/RR-TB regimen but additional resistance is detected later in treatment (after initial DST indicated susceptibility to Group A and B drugs), it can be assumed that further acquisition of resistance may have emerged during that period of drug exposure; such patients should be considered for a treatment outcome of failure and should not continue with the 9-month regimen. The 6-month BPaL or BDLC regimen should not be offered to these patients because amplification may have occurred to linezolid and bedaquiline, key drugs in both the BPaL and BDLC regimens. The patient should switch to a longer individualized regimen, with repeated phenotypic DST to guide the composition of the longer regimen.\n\nPatients who start a 6-month BPaLM or BDLLfxC regimen may change to the 9-month all-oral regimen, if required, provided they meet the necessary eligibility criteria for the 9-month regimen. This may be warranted when toxicity to linezolid develops early in the BPaLM or BDLLfx regimen and necessitates a linezolid-sparing regimen, such as the 9-month regimen with ethionamide.\n\nPatients who start on a longer regimen but are subsequently found to be eligible for the 9-month all-oral regimen may change to the 9-month regimen if this is done within the first month of starting treatment. There is little experience in changing from longer to shorter regimens in this way; hence, clinical monitoring and adequate data collection are important to inform future treatment recommendations.","tokens_est":544,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

The benefits of a shorter regimen for a child with MDR/RR-TB should be weighed against the high pill burden and the difficulties of administering each of the seven drugs in this regimen, particularly if child-friendly formulations of the drugs are not available. Bedaquiline is relatively well tolerated and easy to administer to children; adult- formulation bedaquiline tablets suspended in water have been shown to have the same bioavailability as tablets swallowed whole ( Annex 4 ).\n\nAside from bedaquiline, the medicines that compose the 9-month all-oral regimen have been part of MDR/RR-TB regimens for many years, in similar combinations, for both adults and children. The associated adverse drug reactions have been widely described and the drug dosages established ( Annex 4 ). Child-friendly formulations are now available for all second-line drugs and should be provided to children whenever possible. When these are not available, practical instructions for use of adult formulations for administration are available, so lack of formulation should not be a hindrance to treating children of all ages. This must be addressed as a priority by treatment programmes that include management of children with MDR/RR-TB.\n\nWith dosing and safety data available for use of bedaquiline in children aged below 6 years, the removal of the age restriction for the use of bedaquiline means that children of all ages with MDR/ RR-TB may be offered the 9-month all-oral regimen if they meet the eligibility criteria (56) . Extent of disease is defined slightly differently for children than for adults, and most children with TB have less severe forms of the disease than adults.\n\nEvidence from the SHINE trial (Shorter Treatment for Minimal Tuberculosis in Children), which was the first and only large Phase 3 trial to evaluate the duration of TB treatment in children with nonsevere drug-susceptible TB (DS-TB), suggests that pulmonary TB disease should be classified as severe (which may include extensive, advanced and complicated disease) or non-severe in children (56) . Despite the lack of comparable data among children with MDR/RR-TB disease specifically, the same definitions for severity of disease are likely to be appropriate when considering the use of a shorter regimen for children with MDR/RR-TB. Non-severe disease in children is defined as peripheral lymph node TB; intrathoracic lymph node TB without airway obstruction; uncomplicated TB pleural effusion (without empyema or pneumothorax); or paucibacillary, non-cavitary disease confined to one lobe of the lungs and without a miliary pattern (evaluated on chest X-ray) (56) .\n\nBacteriological confirmation of MDR/RR-TB disease in younger children is relatively uncommon, and the decision to treat for MDR/RR-TB may rely on clinical signs and symptoms, radiological findings and significant exposure to someone with microbiologically confirmed MDR/RR-TB. In children without microbiological confirmation of TB disease or rifampicin resistance, the choice of regimen relies partly on the drug-resistance pattern of the isolate obtained from the most likely index case.","tokens_est":857,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Even less is known about the effects of MDR/RR-TB treatment on the infant in-utero and after birth; however, in general, the benefits (to both parent and child) of providing effective MDR/ RR -TB treatment to the parent far outweigh the potential risks posed to the fetus in-utero or the breastfed infant.\n\nEthionamide is usually contraindicated in pregnancy because animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus, and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans. The physiologic effects of pregnancy, which lead to a relatively low Hb (due to the dilutional effect of increased blood volume) and a higher risk of peripheral neuropathies, may be exacerbated by the adverse effects of linezolid. Nevertheless, the 9-month all-oral regimen including linezolid instead of ethionamide may be considered for pregnant and breastfeeding patients who meet the eligibility criteria for the shorter regimen with linezolid, although closer monitoring is required.\n\nMore compelling evidence on the dosing and safety of specific anti-TB drugs among pregnant and breastfeeding women is needed to guide decision-making on the most appropriate regimen for treatment of MDR/RR-TB during pregnancy and postpartum. In addition, this population group requires considerable adherence support and monitoring of proper administration of MDR/RR-TB treatment, along with other chronic medications, to ensure successful treatment outcomes and minimal risk of TB transmission from mother to infant postpartum.

Many patients with TB also suffer with nutritional deficiencies, and low Hb may also be a result of iron deficiency and low iron stores (59). This deficiency may resolve naturally once effective TB treatment (even including linezolid) leads to resolution of TB symptoms and improvement in the patient’s diet and appetite. Extended use (≥2 weeks) of linezolid has been associated with reversible myelosuppression (60). Therefore, the linezolid-containing 9-month regimen must not be offered to patients with a pretreatment serum Hb below 8 g/dL that cannot be rapidly corrected (i.e. with blood transfusions) before starting MDR/RR-TB treatment. Similarly, owing to the morbidity associated with severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, the linezolid-containing 9-month regimen is not suitable in patients with neutrophils below 750/mm 3 or platelets below 150 000/mm 3 before starting treatment. Some patients respond well to an initial blood transfusion that raises their Hb above 8 g/dL and allows them to at least start a linezolid-containing regimen – linezolid will not necessarily cause myelosuppression in patients with baseline anaemia , although a baseline Hb below 10.5 g/dL has been reported as a risk factor for linezolid-induced anaemia (57) . It is not uncommon for Hb to drop again shortly after blood transfusion in a person with untreated chronic TB disease, but the temporary increase in Hb may allow enough time for a linezolid-containing regimen to be effective in treating the TB disease, and the patient’s Hb is likely to improve as the disease is brought under control.\n\nBlood transfusions may not be a lasting solution in situations where Hb drops significantly from baseline because of linezolid toxicity when linezolid is continued. Although blood transfusions may help to reverse anaemia following withdrawal of linezolid, they may not resolve linezolid-induced myelosuppression with ongoing exposure to the drug. Therefore, if linezolid toxicity leads to a drop in Hb below 8 g/dL during the first 2 months of treatment, linezolid should be withdrawn and the regimen switched appropriately. More research is needed on the role of iron supplementation to treat anaemia during MDR/RR-TB treatment; however, oral supplementation of iron is often not well tolerated and is not immediately effective at the start of treatment, at a time when the pill burden can be overwhelming and the risk of multiple drug side-effects is high.","tokens_est":678,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Therefore, DST is recommended at or before the start of this regimen to exclude resistance to at least FQ and to determine the mutations conferring resistance to isoniazid.\n\nThere are rapid DST methods available for pyrazinamide (LPA, targeted NGS), bedaquiline, clofazimine and linezolid (targeted NGS), which should be performed where available before start of the 9-month regimen. In addition, the critical concentrations for MGIT have been established, enabling NTPs to perform phenotypic DST. If resistance to these drugs is detected , the 9-month regimen should not be offered, or the patient must switch to a longer individualized treatment regimen. In the absence of DST for bedaquiline, linezolid and clofazimine, treatment decisions will rely on the likelihood of effectiveness of these medicines, based on an individual patient’s clinical history and surveillance data from the country or region.

These mutations are found in the inh A promoter and kat G regions, and they confer resistance to isoniazid at different levels. Low-level isoniazid resistance is conferred when only inh A mutations are present, and highlevel resistance is conferred when mutations in the kat G gene are present. Mutations at the inh A promoter region are also associated with resistance to ethionamide and prothionamide . High doses of isoniazid (15–20 mg/kg) are generally considered to be effective in the presence of low-level isoniazid resistance when used as part of combination therapy, but the efficacy of high doses of isoniazid in the presence of kat G mutations remains unclear. Nevertheless, high-dose isoniazid is always included in the 9-month all-oral regimen if either (but not both) of the mutations is present. The presence of mutations in both regions (i.e. inh A promoter and kat G genes) suggests that neither isoniazid at a high dose nor thioamides may be effective and therefore the 9-month all-oral regimen is not appropriate in these cases. In the South African setting, the detection of both mutations in MDR-TB strains was considered a surrogate marker for more extensive drug resistance at the time that the 9-month linezolid-containing regimen was introduced. Patients in South Africa who had MDR-TB with both mutations were not considered eligible for the 9-month regimen, and so were not included in the routine dataset presented to the GDG for review. Thus, the efficacy of the 9-month regimen in such cases is largely unknown. In the absence of information on isoniazid resistance or mutation patterns in the case of an individual patient, knowledge of the prevalence of both mutations among locally circulating RR-TB strains (e.g. from DRS in the relevant epidemiological setting) may also inform decisions as to which treatment regimen would be most appropriate. DST for ethambutol is not carried out routinely in most settings. Results of DST for ethambutol and pyrazinamide do not affect eligibility for the 9-month all-oral regimen.\n\nThe 9-month regimen is standardized and all seven drugs (including either ethionamide or linezolid) should be initiated from the outset. Pyrazinamide and ethambutol are inexpensive and generally well tolerated, and they may still be efficacious against MDR/RR-TB in people who are eligible for this regimen. However, some health care providers and patients, particularly children and their caregivers, might find the high pill burden posed by these medicines challenging despite the shorter duration of this treatment regimen.\n\nResults of DST should not delay the start of an appropriate MDR/RR-TB treatment regimen, particularly if DST relies on phenotypic methods (61, 62) . Box 2.5.1 and Box 2.5.2 below provide examples of clinical scenarios and appropriate choices of regimens .\n\nTB programmes must rapidly build the capacity to undertake DST, and all efforts must be made to ensure access to approved tests. If routine genotypic and phenotypic DST for clofazimine, linezolid and bedaquiline is not feasible for all patients diagnosed with MDR/RR-TB, then DST for these drugs must be prioritized for patients with positive TB sputum cultures at month 4 of treatment or beyond. Delayed conversion to negative cultures, or reversion to positive cultures, after 4 months of MDR/ RR-TB treatment may be an early indication that treatment is failing, and clinicians must consider the possibility of acquired drug resistance (63).","tokens_est":919,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Among these regimens, using BLMZ is suggested over using BLLfxCZ , and BLLfxCZ is suggested over BDLLfxZ . (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)\n\nRecommendation 2.3 (NEW) WHO suggests against using 9-month DCLLfxZ or DCMZ regimens compared with currently recommended longer (>18 months) regimens in patients with fluoroquinolone-susceptible MDR/RR-TB. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)\n\nRemarks\n\n1. The recommended modified 9-month all-oral regimens comprise bedaquiline, linezolid and pyrazinamide in different combinations with levofloxacin/moxifloxacin, clofazimine and delamanid.\n\n2. This recommendation applies to the following:\n\na. People with MDR/RR-TB and in whom resistance to fluoroquinolones has been excluded.\n\nb. People with diagnosed pulmonary TB, including children, adolescents, PLHIV, and pregnant and breastfeeding women.\n\nc. People with extensive TB disease and all forms of extrapulmonary TB except for TB involving the CNS, osteoarticular TB or disseminated forms of TB with multiorgan involvement.\n\nd. People with MDR/RR-TB and less than 1 month of previous exposure to any of the component medicines of the regimen (apart from pyrazinamide and fluoroquinolones).

Children and adolescents who do not have bacteriological confirmation of TB or resistance patterns but do have a high likelihood of MDR/RR-TB (based on clinical signs and symptoms of TB, in combination with a history of contact with a patient with confirmed MDR/RR-TB).\n\nThe recommendations for the three new modified 9-month all-oral regimens for MDR/RR-TB are primarily based on findings from the endTB trial, a non- blinded, RCT with five experimental arms compared with a control group. The control arm of the endTB trial used the longer WHO-recommended regimen, because enrolment occurred before the 2022 WHO recommendation establishing BPaLM as the preferred regimen for MDR/RR-TB. After reviewing the trial data, the GDG has determined that the BLMZ , BLLfxCZ and BDLLfxZ regimens are preferred over the longer regimens currently in use.\n\nThe recommended four- and five-drug regimens include different combinations coming from a set of seven TB drugs commonly used in DR-TB treatment: bedaquiline (B), levofloxacin ( Lfx ), moxifloxacin (M), linezolid (L), clofazimine (C), delamanid (D) and pyrazinamide (Z). These regimens are specifically recommended for patients with MDR/RR-TB who do not have FQ resistance and they apply to diverse groups as outlined in the recommendation remarks (see Section 5.2.1 below).\n\nAll three regimens demonstrated high efficacy, with week 104 treatment outcomes showing favourable results in 89% of patients on BLMZ (95% CI: 82–94%), 89% on BLLfxCZ (95% CI: 81–94%) and 85% on BDLLfxCZ (78–91%).","tokens_est":867,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

The WHO GDG made this ranking based on an evaluation of all evidence and judgements made for individual regimens, together with multiple comparisons of three recommended regimens based on the following six decision criteria: balance of effects, resources required, cost–effectiveness, equity, acceptability and feasibility (1) . The rationale for the ranking can be summarized as follows:\n\n• BLMZ was preferred over BLLfxCZ and BDLLfxZ :\n\n‒ BLMZ appeared preferable in terms of the balance of health effects compared with both BLLfxCZ and BDLLfxZ ;\n\n‒ BLMZ has the lowest cost and pill burden, and appeared either preferable or equivalent for all other decision criteria; and\n\n‒ BLMZ was therefore deemed to be the preferred regimen among the three.\n\n• BLLfxCZ , was preferred over BDLLfxZ :\n\n‒ BLLfxCZ , compared with BDLLfxZ , was deemed to have a similar but slightly preferable balance of health effects;\n\n‒ BLLfxCZ also has a significantly lower cost and a lower pill burden than BDLLfxZ ;\n\n‒ the much greater cost of BDLLfxZ was judged as being likely to have negative effects on equity, acceptability and feasibility; and\n\n‒ BLLfxCZ was therefore deemed to be preferrable to BDLLfxZ .\n\nAlthough all three regimens showed a similar proportion of participants experiencing Grade 3 or higher AEs, BLMZ consists of only four drugs, which may result in a lower pill burden and fewer sideeffects . BLLfxCZ includes five drugs, with levofloxacin offering a better side-effect profile regarding QT prolongation than moxifloxacin; however, the inclusion of clofazimine, known for causing significant QT prolongation and other AEs, is a drawback. BDLLfxZ also contains five drugs, but while delamanid has a favourable side-effect profile, its high cost makes this regimen less favourable .\n\nTwo of the five regimens used in the endTB trial, DCLLfxZ and DCMZ, underperformed compared with the others, leading to a recommendation against their use. Specifically, the DCLLfxZ and DCMZ regimens exhibited much higher rates of failure and acquired drug resistance than the longer regimen and the three recommended modified 9-month regimens. The absence of bedaquiline, a potent bactericidal drug, may explain their reduced efficacy. Until further evidence clarifies their potential role, these regimens should not be used.\n\nAdditionally, the GDG had access to data from operational research cohorts that used various four- and five-drug 9-month regimens under programmatic conditions. However, these regimens often deviated from the three recommended regimens (BLMZ, BLLfxCZ and BDLLfxZ ). Specifically, many operational research cohort regimens excluded pyrazinamide and frequently included cycloserine . Due to the limitations of evidence – primarily derived from observational studies that lack direct comparisons and are challenging to align with clinical trial data – the GDG was unable to directly compare these alternative 9-month regimens with the newly recommended modified 9-month regimens. Nevertheless, evidence from operational research studies, including one conducted across more than 13 eastern European countries using a regimen similar to BCLLfxZ (with cycloserine replacing pyrazinamide), provided valuable reassurance about the feasibility of implementing such regimens. It is expected that this evidence will support and expedite the adoption of the recommended modified 9-month regimens, particularly in countries that participated in the operational research studies.\n\nThe role of the modified 9-month regimens within the broader range of WHO-approved treatments for MDR/RR-TB is discussed in detail in Section 3.3 .","tokens_est":950,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Levofloxacin was dosed at 750 mg per day (versus 500 mg) for the >24–30 kg category, and pyrazinamide was dosed at 800 mg for >24–30 kg and >30–35 kg, and 1200 mg for >35–40 kg. These differences are minor, and programmes may adopt either the endTB trial dosing or the recommendations in Annex 1 and Annex 4 .) The dosing for linezolid and bedaquiline in these regimens:\n\n• Bedaquiline is dosed at 400 mg (four 100 mg tablets) daily for the first 2 weeks, followed by 200 mg (two 100 mg tablets) three times a week (e.g. Monday, Wednesday and Friday) in adults for the full 9-month period.

If Hb drops below 8 g/dL during the first 4 months of therapy because of linezolid toxicity, linezolid should be temporarily discontinued; if Hb does not recover, the linezolid may need to be permanently stopped. If the patient receives linezolid for less than 4 months, the regimen may need to be modified or a new regimen given. Temporary blood transfusions may allow the patient to initiate or continue treatment while the underlying TB is controlled, because anaemia often improves as the disease resolves.

More frequent testing should be considered in the presence of individual risk factors for liver toxicity.\n\n• Pyrazinamide DST:\n\n‒ If DST is available, it should be used at baseline; however, regimens may still be used in the absence of pyrazinamide resistance testing or while waiting for results.\n\n‒ If the isolate is susceptible to pyrazinamide, the regimen should be continued, with pyrazinamide only discontinued if toxicity occurs.\n\n‒ If resistance to pyrazinamide is confirmed, the drug can be discontinued. This guidance, provided by the GDG, recognizes the potential for limited retained activity owing to possible synergy between bedaquiline and pyrazinamide (74) , even in the presence of pyrazinamide resistance. However, this synergy is likely to be modest and must be carefully weighed against pyrazinamide’s toxicity profile.\n\n‒ In all cases, whether pyrazinamide-resistant or pyrazinamide-sensitive, standard practices on treatment outcome assessment should be followed regarding when to switch the regimen if the patient is not responding well to treatment (see Section 9.7 ).\n\n• No pyrazinamide DST available:\n\n‒ In the absence of pyrazinamide DST, decisions regarding temporary suspension, permanent discontinuation or switching to regimens that do not employ pyrazinamide (6-month regimens or the longer regimen) should be based on the severity of pyrazinamide-induced hepatotoxicity. Principles for managing drug-induced hepatotoxicity are detailed in Annex 2 .\n\nIn summary, the similarity in treatment outcomes between pyrazinamide-resistant and pyrazinamidesensitive strains across all three modified regimens underscores the robustness of the modified 9-month regimens. Although pyrazinamide sensitivity appears to provide an advantage, the resistance does not significantly hinder treatment success. Thus, even though pyrazinamide contributes positively to treatment, it does not appear to be the critical driver of success in these regimens . Use of pyrazinamide requires careful monitoring. In patients with multiple risk factors for hepatotoxicity or advanced liver disease (with or without pyrazinamide resistance), more frequent liver enzyme monitoring or use of alternative regimens may be more appropriate. Regular LFTs and sound clinical judgement are critical to optimizing treatment outcomes while minimizing the risk of serious AEs.","tokens_est":647,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Treatment of drug-resistant TB using longer regimens\n\nThe design of longer regimens (18–20 months) is founded on grouping of medicines recommended for use in longer regimens based on the drug-resistance profile ( Table 2.6.1 ).\n\nIn ideal conditions, only a small proportion of MDR/RR-TB patients should opt for longer regimens , because this indication is mainly for those who cannot benefit from either BPaLM / BPaL or the 9-month all-oral regimen. Reasons for not using the shorter regimens may be related to the age of the patients, additional resistance (including FQ resistance and other Group A medicines; i.e. XDR-TB), intolerance to key medicines used in shorter regimens, severity of disease, pregnancy, certain types of extrapulmonary TB or other complications needing an individualized approach.\n\nUnder many of these circumstances, only less potent and more toxic drugs are left to be used for treatment and lengthy regimens are therefore needed to cure without relapse. Longer regimens, especially if clinical conditions are complex (e.g. advanced disease with higher burden of bacilli and severe disease affecting critical organs) are usually associated with higher likelihood of toxicity, owing to factors such as longer drug exposure, higher intolerance, adverse effects and greater potential for DDIs in critically ill patients.\n\nAll these conditions that may lead to less patient-friendly regimens with higher pill burden and toxicity can increase the likelihood of unfavourable treatment outcomes such as treatment failure, LTFU and death. All DR-TB patients need a patient- centred approach with treatment adherence support and aDSM , but in longer regimens these activities become more crucial. Patients will need support to overcome the hardships associated with TB and its treatment, including daily adherence challenges, adverse drug reactions, indirect costs and stigma.\n\nRecommendation 3.1: In multidrug- or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) patients on longer regimens, all three Group A agents and at least one Group B agent should be included to ensure that treatment starts with at least four TB agents likely to be effective, and that at least three agents are included for the rest of treatment if bedaquiline is stopped.

At least four drugs must be selected, starting from Group A and then from Group B. Group C drugs are usually included in a longer regimen if it cannot be composed with Group A and B agents alone. The choice of drugs from Group C is usually determined by the order in which the medicines are ranked, and by the individual circumstances of the patient and the setting. A recent review of the observational data found no additional safety concerns when bedaquiline was used for longer than 6 months; however, no clear evidence was available to indicate whether longer use added efficacy (1) . The clinicians may therefore consider continuing bedaquiline for longer than 6 months and adding some flexibility for regimen design and the number of effective drugs.\n\nIn the case of longer treatment regimens, an individual approach is needed. Therefore, apart from the drug classification, it is crucial to optimize drug selection according to the patient’s clinical condition and the drug-resistance pattern. Considerations include:\n\n• the clinical history of drugs taken in the past by the patient or the index case, or according to local resistance epidemiology in the country or region;\n\n• the DST results – where available, is it of utmost importance to guide the drug selection using phenotypic or genotypic DST; in patients with extensive patterns of resistance, whenever possible, it is advised to perform whole genome sequencing; and\n\n• selecting drugs according to their special features – in addition to susceptibility, key drug features and clinical particularities of the patient that may boost survival must be considered (e.g. likelihood of effectiveness, CNS penetration, drug–drug interaction profile, tolerance and patient preference, oral absorption and bioavailability).\n\nMost anti-TB drugs are used once daily to achieve a high peak serum concentration that increases the bactericidal and sterilizing effect and to support adherence (to avoid missed or partial doses). The doses of anti-TB drugs by weight bands are outlined in the Annex 4 . The essential information about TB medicines used in MDR/RR-TB treatment is described in detail in Annex 1 .\n\nMany patients may have comorbidities and AEs that need to be addressed separately. Hospitalization, surgery and other adjuvant treatment may be needed at certain stages of treatment. Comprehensive monitoring and treatment adherence support are important to ensure a favourable treatment experience. Access to palliative and end-of-life care services may be needed, with a patient- centred approach to relieve the suffering from the disease and its treatment (77) . Respiratory infection control measures at the sites where the patient is being treated, contact tracing and counselling are important accompanying measures for clinical care and public health.\n\nThe Table 2.6.2 summarizes some common situations that a clinician may face, and the decisions that could be taken to adjust the treatment regimen accordingly. The suggested regimens may vary based on the individual clinical circumstances and the availability of medicines. Table 2.6.2 is not exhaustive. Although it is recommended to use at least four effective agents initially, not all the regimens composed using this algorithm have been tested directly in either research or field conditions. Moreover, when Group C agents are included, the number of medicines in the regimen may exceed four, to reflect the uncertainty about the efficacy of some of these medicines. In such situations, the advice of a specialist is important to ensure the safest and most effective possible regimen .","tokens_est":977,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

TB medicines to be used for treatment of MDR/RR-TB are categorized into Groups A, B and C ( Table 2.6.1 ) (1) . This classification is based on drug class and level of certainty in the evidence on effectiveness and safety (i.e. balance between benefits and risk of harm). The data analysed relate mainly to adult patients who received regimens in recent years. Groups A–C feature the medicines to be used to compose longer MDR-TB regimens. WHO considers that, under programmatic conditions, only these medicines (Groups A–C) have a role in longer MDR-TB treatment regimens . In addition to agents from Groups A–C, the potential role for clavulanic acid and high-dose isoniazid was discussed (see “Other medicines” in this section).\n\nThe most notable differences between the classification of longer regimen components used before 2018 and the current guidelines are an upgrade in the priority of bedaquiline, linezolid, clofazimine and cycloserine /terizidone; placement of delamanid in Group C; and lowering of priority for pyrazinamide, amikacin, streptomycin, ethionamide/ prothionamide and p - aminosalicylic acid, relative to other treatment options. Several agents that were featured previously in these groups are no longer included because they are:\n\n• no longer recommended (e.g. ofloxacin, capreomycin and kanamycin );\n\n• rarely used in longer regimens (e.g. high-dose isoniazid); or\n\n• an adjunct agent that is not intended to be used alone (e.g. clavulanic acid is used only in combination with the carbapenems).\n\nThe classification facilitates design of the treatment regimen for patients with DR-TB who are not eligible for the BPaLM / BPaL or 9-month treatment regimens. Table 2.6.1 summarizes the general steps to take when including agents for the longer MDR-TB regimen according to the latest WHO guidance, with more details provided for some of the most common situations and patient subgroups that clinicians and NTPs may encounter.","tokens_est":545,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Medicines in Group C are ranked by decreasing order of usual preference for use, subject to other considerations. The 2018 IPD meta-analysis for longer regimens included no patients on thioacetazone and high-dose isoniazid, for a meaningful analysis. No recommendation on perchlozone , interferon gamma or sutezolid was possible owing to the absence of final patient treatment outcome data from appropriate studies.\n[b] Bedaquiline is usually administered 400 mg orally once daily for the first 2 weeks, followed by 200 mg orally thrice weekly for 22 weeks (total duration of 24 weeks). As a result of multiple reviews following new data gradually becoming available, the use of bedaquiline is not restricted by age of the patient. Evidence on the safety and effectiveness of bedaquiline use beyond 6 months was insufficient for review in 2018. Therefore, the use of bedaquiline beyond 6 months was implemented following best practices in “off-label” use . New evidence on the safety profile of bedaquiline use beyond 6 months was available to the GDG in 2019, but the GDG was not able to assess the impact of prolonged bedaquiline use on efficacy, owing to the limited evidence and potential residual confounding in the data. However, the evidence supports the safe use of bedaquiline beyond 6 months in patients who receive appropriate schedules of baseline and follow-up monitoring. The use of bedaquiline beyond 6 months still remains as off-label use and, in this regard, best practices in off-label use still apply.\n[c] Evidence on the concurrent use of bedaquiline and delamanid was insufficient for review in 2018. In 2019, new evidence on both the safety and effectiveness of concurrent use of bedaquiline and delamanid was made available to the GDG. In relation to safety, the GDG concluded that the data suggested no additional safety concerns regarding concurrent use of bedaquiline and delamanid. More evidence was added to that regard between 2020 and 2022 . Both medicines may be used concurrently in patients who have limited other treatment options available to them, and if sufficient monitoring (including baseline and follow-up ECG and electrolyte monitoring) is in place. The data on the effectiveness of concurrent use of bedaquiline and delamanid were reviewed by the GDG in 2019, but owing to the limited evidence and potential residual confounding in the data, the GDG could not proceed with a recommendation on effectiveness.\n[d] Use of linezolid for at least 6 months was shown to increase effectiveness, although toxicity may limit its use. The analysis suggested that using linezolid for the whole duration of treatment would optimize its effect (about 70% of patients on linezolid with data received it for more than 6 months, and 30% for 18 months or the whole duration). No patient predictors for early cessation of linezolid could be inferred from the IPD subanalysis .\n[e] Evidence on the safety and effectiveness of delamanid beyond 6 months was insufficient for review. The use of delamanid beyond these limits should follow best practices in “off-label” use. As a result of multiple reviews following new data gradually becoming available throughout the years the use of delamanid is not restricted by age of the patient.\n[f ] Pyrazinamide is only counted as an effective agent when DST results confirm susceptibility.\n[g] Every dose of imipenem– cilastatin or meropenem should be preceded by the oral administration of oral clavulanic acid 30–60 minutes beforehand; oral clavulanic acid is only available in formulations combined with amoxicillin. Amoxicillin–clavulanic acid is not counted as an additional effective TB agent and should not be used without imipenem– cilastatin or meropenem.\n[h] Amikacin and streptomycin are only to be considered if DST results confirm susceptibility and high-quality audiology monitoring for hearing loss can be ensured. Streptomycin is to be considered only if amikacin cannot be used (unavailable or documented resistance) and if DST results confirm susceptibility (streptomycin resistance is not detectable with second-line molecular LPAs and phenotypic DST is required). Kanamycin and capreomycin are no longer recommended for use in MDR-TB regimens.\n[ i ] These agents only showed effectiveness in regimens without bedaquiline, linezolid, clofazimine or delamanid and are thus only proposed when other options to compose a regimen are not possible.

Levofloxacin and moxifloxacin appear to be equally effective in FQ-susceptible patients receiving longer regimens, and either of these drugs can be considered for MDR/RR-TB treatment using these regimens. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin are less effective in MDR-TB treatment and are no longer recommended.\n\nReliable rapid molecular DST is available for levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (including Xpert MTB/ XDR and second-line LPA). Not all point mutations present the same resistance profile. Despite some mutations having consistently high minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) (i.e. gyr A D94N or D94Y), most mutations present a range of phenotypic resistance that may cross critical concentration (CC) and clinical breakpoint (CB) levels. Therefore, once FQ resistance has been detected by molecular methods and treatment has started, a phenotypic method may be used as a reference test for distinguishing between high-level (>CB) and low-level (>CC and <CB) resistance mutations, possibly allowing for the use of a high-level FQ dose. Where these mutations are detected, the composition of the longer regimen should be re-evaluated based on phenotypic DST results at the CB (82) .\n\nIf DST for moxifloxacin confirms high-level resistance, or if the patient’s history suggests that moxifloxacin has not been effective (e.g. if used in a failing regimen for more than 15–30 days), moxifloxacin should not be used.

There is growing experience of its use in children, adolescents and older people, patients with extrapulmonary TB disease and PLHIV (85, 86) . Currently, there is no age restriction for the use of bedaquiline, including in longer regimens (56) .\n\nAnalyses of observational study data highlighted the improved survival of patients treated with regimens containing bedaquiline (56) and the favourable safety profile of bedaquiline when the drug is used alongside other TB medicines, including medicines with a QT prolongation effect (e.g. moxifloxacin, clofazimine and delamanid) (87–92) . The recent data review for the WHO consolidated guidelines (1) suggested no additional safety concerns for the use of bedaquiline beyond 6 months, used concurrently with delamanid or in pregnancy (89) . The available data suggested that the concurrent use of bedaquiline and delamanid does not increase the risk of clinically meaningful QT prolongation (93) .\n\nSome inconclusive evidence is emerging; for example, some published data on the rapid advent of bedaquiline resistance in settings where it is used may suggest a possibility of bedaquiline being a low genetic barrier drug (i.e. causing resistance to emerge rapidly) as a result of frequent natural mutations. Also worth considering is the long half-life of the drug (5.5 months), which may lead to the drug acting as monotherapy in patients lost to follow-up. FQ resistance testing should be performed to prevent bedaquiline resistance acquisition, and the levels of resistance should be monitored when possible. Bedaquiline presents cross-resistance with clofazimine in cases of Rv0678 gene mutation (which lead to upregulation of efflux pumps) and pepQ mutations. Resistance may occur spontaneously, even without prior exposure to bedaquiline or clofazimine (4.1% in some studies) (94, 95) .

The 2018 IPD meta-analysis informing the WHO guidelines included information from more than 300 patients who were treated with linezolid for at least 1 month, mostly on 600 mg daily. About 30% of patients received linezolid for 1–6 months, but over 30% received it for more than 18 months, and these patients had the lowest frequency of treatment failure, LTFU and death. This analysis also suggested that the optimal duration of use would be about 20 months, corresponding to the usual total duration of a longer MDR-TB regimen; however, the analysis did not account for survivorship bias (i.e. that those who complete the full length of treatment are more likely to have a successful outcome, given that deaths and losses to follow-up occur earlier) (1, 101) .\n\nThe evidence from the WHO consolidated guidelines (1) suggests that linezolid should be used for as long as it is tolerated. There may be improved outcomes if linezolid is used for the full duration of treatment. However, it probably has its greatest added effect (including protection of other secondline drugs against acquired drug resistance) during the first months of treatment when the bacillary load is highest (102) . If toxicity develops, dosing of linezolid should be reduced or replaced by another bactericidal drug (15) .\n\nLinezolid is not affected or metabolized by the cytochrome p450; however, it is an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (IMAO), leading to an increase in serotonin and tyramine levels. Serotonergic syndrome, which can be serious and life threatening, can result when linezolid is given concomitantly with other IMAO drugs that are often used in clinical practice in TB patients (e.g. antidepressants, opioid pain killers such as tramadol, common cold medications or antitussives such as dextromethorphan) (103) .","tokens_est":551,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

There is no age restriction for use of delamanid and there are currently dispersible formulations that are preferred over crushing and dispersing adult tablets (56, 104) . Delamanid is strongly bound to plasma proteins, resulting in low CNS penetration; however, studies in humans and animals with CNS TB suggest that delamanid could potentially play a beneficial role when other options are not available (105) .\n\nThe recent data review for the WHO guidelines (1) suggested that there are no additional safety concerns for concurrent use of delamanid with bedaquiline. The combined QT effects, compared with bedaquiline or delamanid alone, were evaluated in an RCT of 75 patients (>3000 ECGs) (90) . Studies undertaken between 2020 and 2022 had shown no increased toxicity with the use of delamanid beyond 6 months; they showed safety on the concomitant use of delamanid with bedaquiline, while increasing rates of survival of patients with restricted therapeutic options (79, 93) .\n\nAnimal data show no evidence of teratogenicity. Although the case series of pregnant women on delamanid are small, all children had excellent birth outcomes, suggesting that pregnant women in need should not be denied access to delamanid.

Other evidence suggests that high-dose isoniazid may also be useful in the longer MDR-TB regimens. First, in the systematic review and IPD meta-analysis commissioned by WHO in 2015 to describe treatment outcomes in children with MDR-TB (which included 975 children in 18 countries), the use of high-dose isoniazid was associated with treatment success among children with confirmed MDR-TB (adjusted odds ratio [ aOR ] 5.9,\n\n95% CI: 1.7–20.5, P =0.007) (118, 119) . Second, in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial among adults with MDR-TB, participants who received high-dose isoniazid (16–18 mg/ kg) (added to kanamycin, levofloxacin, prothionamide , cycloserine and PAS) were significantly more likely to experience culture conversion at 6 months of treatment than those receiving placebo or standard-dose isoniazid (5 mg/kg) (73.8% versus 48.8% or 45.0%, respectively), with median time to culture conversion significantly reduced in the high-dose isoniazid arm (3.4 versus 6.6 or 6.4 months, respectively) (120) . Third, a more recent early bactericidal activity study among patients with MDR-TB – in which the isoniazid resistance was mediated by isolated inh A mutations – demonstrated that doses of 10–15 mg/kg of isoniazid daily exhibited bactericidal activity similar to standard-dose isoniazid (5 mg/kg) given to patients with DS-TB (121) . Strains with isolated kat G or both kat G and inh A mutations are unlikely to respond even to high-dose isoniazid, given the typically high isoniazid MICs in those strains. In the absence of information on isoniazid mutation patterns for an individual patient, knowledge of the prevalence of both mutations among locally circulating RR-TB strains (e.g. from DRS in the relevant epidemiological setting) may also inform decisions as to which treatment regimens would be most appropriate.","tokens_est":563,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Rifampicin resistance needs to be excluded using rapid molecular tests (e.g. Xpert MTB/RIF) before levofloxacin is used, to avoid the inadvertent treatment of MDR/RR-TB with an inadequate regimen. Ideally, rapid DST for FQ and pyrazinamide is also performed.\n\nIt is not advisable to give a regimen for Hr -TB unless isoniazid resistance is confirmed or highly suspected (e.g. confirmed TB patient who is the close contact of a documented Hr -TB case). This will avert the unnecessary use of levofloxacin and prolonged pyrazinamide exposure in TB patients who may be cured with 2HRZE/4HR. Once the Hr -TB regimen has been started, if the results of initial DST reveal isoniazid susceptibility, the regimen may be modified so that the patient effectively completes a course of first-line TB treatment.\n\nThe recommendations apply to both adults and children, including PLHIV. Thus, HIV testing and treatment of PLHIV with ART is important, and the aim is to start ART within 8 weeks of TB treatment initiation (regardless of CD4 count), or within the first 2 weeks in patients with profound immunosuppression (e.g. CD4 counts <50 cells/mm 3 ) (128) . The regimen is also likely to be effective in patients with extrapulmonary Hr -TB; however, consultation with appropriate specialists is advised.\n\nHr -TB treatment is expected to be started if either of the following circumstances apply:\n\n• Hr -TB is confirmed and rifampicin resistance is ruled out before TB treatment is started – in such cases, the 6(H)RZE- Lfx regimen is started immediately. If the diagnosis is strongly presumed (e.g. close contact of a confirmed Hr -TB source case) but results of DST are still pending, the regimen may be introduced. Should DST results taken at the start eventually show susceptibility to isoniazid, then levofloxacin is stopped and the patient continues treatment to complete a 2HRZE/4HR regimen.\n\n• Hr -TB is discovered after the start of treatment with the 2HRZE/4HR regimen (this includes patients who had undiagnosed isoniazid resistance at the start or who developed isoniazid resistance while on first-line treatment) – in such cases, rapid molecular testing for rifampicin resistance must be undertaken (or repeated). Once rifampicin resistance has been excluded, a full 6-month course of (H)RZE- Lfx is given. The duration is driven by the need to give levofloxacin for 6 months, which usually implies that the companion first-line medicines are taken for longer than 6 months. A report of resistance during treatment presents the clinician with a challenge, because the results may no longer reflect the drug susceptibility of the current bacterial population, given that an inadequate regimen – at times a functional monotherapy – may have favoured the acquisition of additional resistance in the interval. The unexpected discovery of resistance to one agent should prompt the clinician to repeat DST for other agents in the regimen. The example in Box 2.7.1 illustrates a typical situation that could arise.","tokens_est":786,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

This implies that, when Hr -TB is diagnosed after the start of the regimen for treatment of DS-TB, the companion medicines (HRZE) would end up being given for more than 6 months.\n\nIn patients with cavitary disease and with persistent positivity on sputum smear and culture, prolongation of (H)RZE- Lfx beyond 6 months could be considered on a case-by-case basis. Prolongation of treatment increases the risk of toxicity, particularly from pyrazinamide and ethambutol, which are usually only given for 2 months in the first-line TB regimen. The evidence reviewed for the WHO guidance on Hr -TB precluded a recommendation to limit the pyrazinamide duration to less than 4 months when a FQ is given.\n\nLevofloxacin is the preferred FQ for Hr -TB regimens. The exposure to moxifloxacin decreases markedly when it is combined with rifampicin (129) . This effect has not been reported in the case of levofloxacin; also, levofloxacin appears to cause less QT interval prolongation than moxifloxacin (55, 130, 131) .\n\nLevofloxacin is included in Hr -TB regimens except in the following instances: when rifampicin resistance cannot be tested for, when there is documented resistance or known intolerance to FQ, and when there is preexisting prolongation of the QT interval and pregnancy. If a FQ cannot be used, a patient with Hr -TB can still be treated with 6(H)RZE; streptomycin is not required in such cases.\n\nFor patient convenience and ease of administration, the HRZE FDC may be used to treat Hr -TB (given that no RZE FDC is currently available). The dosage of other TB medicines in the Hr -TB regimen is the same as in the standardized DS-TB 2HRZE/4HR regimen. The inclusion of isoniazid in the regimen has not been shown to lead to substantial benefit or harm to patients; however, isoniazid may increase the hepatotoxicity of pyrazinamide (132, 133) . High-dose isoniazid (10–15 mg/kg per day) may still be effective when used in combination regimens in the presence of isolated inh A mutations linked to low MIC, even in “fast acetylators” (i.e. individuals who metabolize isoniazid rapidly) (134) . In the presence of both inh A and kat G mutations, addition of isoniazid (even at a high dose) is unlikely to add value to the regimen.","tokens_est":597,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Treatment is given daily, and intermittent treatment should be avoided. Relevant measures to support adherence, social support and the use of digital technologies should be considered to ensure favourable treatment outcomes (17) .\n\nThe cost of medicines to compose a full 6(H)RZE regimen with levofloxacin is slightly higher than the cost of a 2HRZE/4HR regimen used for DS-TB (135) . Nonetheless, the 6(H)RZE regimen is an affordable and feasible intervention, even in low-income settings. Use of FDCs simplifies treatment and lowers costs, and the use of dispersible formulations of HRZ, ethambutol and levofloxacin is preferred in children. As with the treatment of other forms of TB, the expenses associated with the proper delivery of care (e.g. DST, adherence support and clinical monitoring) far exceed the cost of medicines.\n\nA new diagnostic platform has been approved for the detection of Hr -TB – the new Xpert MTB/ XDR cartridge, which can detect isoniazid resistance in less than 90 minutes, matching the rapidity and convenience of Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance. First-line LPA can also detect isoniazid resistance, and the infrastructure required is typically available in a provincial or central level facility. Typical processing time for an LPA specimen is about 2–3 days, owing to batching. DST based on liquid culture (or MGIT) could also detect Hr -TB at the level of a reference laboratory, but this means a processing delay of at least 10 days. Testing on solid media is also an option, but it takes several months to obtain results; hence, this approach is of limited use for baseline testing and monitoring of treatment response.\n\nCurrent epidemiological data indicate that more than three quarters of the global burden of Hr -TB occurs among previously untreated (“new”) TB cases. Previous TB treatment is thus not a strong indicator of risk of Hr -TB – the correlation with previous TB treatment is weaker than it is with MDR-TB. Reserving isoniazid DST to such patients is therefore unlikely to yield many Hr -TB cases. There are various concerns about empirical Hr -TB treatment of previously treated TB cases, without prior DST. First, such treatment will lead to unnecessary overtreatment with FQ and prolongation of pyrazinamide use in many patients. Most recurrent cases will not have Hr -TB and can be cured with a 2HRZE/4HR regimen. Second, unless rifampicin resistance is excluded at the baseline, patients with MDR/RR-TB would be exposed to an inadequate regimen, with the risk of acquiring additional resistance, including FQ. Third, this policy would deflect the focus of the programme from testing new TB patients, who usually harbour the main burden of Hr -TB. Finally, this approach would risk creating once again a “re-treatment regimen”, similar to the situation that prevailed in many settings until recently with the indiscriminate use of the streptomycin-containing 8-month “Category 2” regimen in all previously treated TB patients.\n\nIn a situation where access to DST is good, a logical diagnostic algorithm would start with Xpert MTB/ RIF as the initial test for all patients evaluated for TB. Cases in whom TB is confirmed and rifampicin resistance is not detected would be further tested with Xpert MTB/XDR or LPA. Liquid culture may replace LPA, but the additional delay in obtaining results is a disadvantage.","tokens_est":895,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Bacteriological monitoring of sputum generally follows the same schedule as DS-TB, with direct microscopy at months 2, 5 and 6. It is desirable, however, to perform a culture together with smear microscopy (or at least in the last month of treatment) to check for any emergent resistance, especially to rifampicin. Non-response to treatment should be investigated with DST.\n\nLiver and kidney function and other blood tests may be necessary, based on clinical manifestations and medications in use. ECG for patients on 6(H)RZE- Lfx is not usually required unless there are other risks for QT interval prolongation. The first -line TB agents may cause adverse drug reactions, which are mostly mild, not serious and self-limiting or manageable with basic measures. TB practitioners are likely to be more familiar with the use of these medicines than with levofloxacin, which has a fairly good safety profile in both adults and children when used at the dose recommended in the Annex 4 , even when taken for longer than 6 months. Dosage adjustment, in consultation with a specialist, is recommended if creatinine clearance is below 30 mL/min (15) . Adverse drug reactions should be reported to the spontaneous pharmacovigilance systems required by national regulations, as for other drug-related harms. In patients on regimens for Hr -TB, aDSM is not mandatory.\n\nAs with all other notifiable TB cases, patients with Hr -TB should be registered in the TB register, regardless of whether treatment has started, or whether a regimen containing second-line TB medicines is being given (113) . The case may be retained in the TB register for the purposes of monitoring the treatment response and the interim or final outcomes. Cases without Hr -TB may be enumerated with the main DS-TB cases for the purposes of treatment outcome reporting. Hr -TB cases given FQ or other second-line agents in addition to 6(H)RZE may also be registered in the secondline TB register if the programme wishes to monitor how many patients are being given regimens containing second-line medicines (15) . If this is done, it is important that cases without RR-TB are not enumerated with the MDR/RR-TB cohort for treatment outcome monitoring purposes.\n\nIt will be helpful to monitor efforts to improve testing coverage, detection, enrolment and outcomes for Hr -TB separately from other TB or MDR/RR-TB cases. The indicators for MDR/RR-TB may be adapted for this purpose; outcome definitions are the same as for non-MDR/RR-TB (113) . Reporting can be at the same frequency as that recommended for standard monitoring of other TB cohorts.\n\nCombining data for patients with different resistance patterns into a single cohort may complicate comparison of performance between centres and determination of trends over time, given that these patients may have different risks for treatment failure. However, treatment of TB patients who do not have rifampicin resistance with regimens discussed in this section should lead to a successful outcome in most patients, and maximizing the likelihood of success should be the end objective of TB programmes . The use of electronic case-based databases facilitates the grouping of patients by comparable resistance patterns or treatment episodes to undertake more advanced analyses, allowing adjustment for at least some covariates. Programmes are encouraged to follow good practices when collecting these data, and to participate in collaborative initiatives to share individual patient records for pooled reviews of global patient series (136–139) . Such data could be useful to guide future policy on the optimization of regimens for the treatment of DR-TB.","tokens_est":958,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

With the challenging prospect that more cases of MDR/XDR-TB are virtually untreatable with all available drugs or risk having serious sequelae, there has been re-evaluation of the role of pulmonary surgery as a way to reduce the amount of lung tissue with intractable pathology and to reduce the bacterial load. Large case series have reported that resection surgery may be safe and an effective adjunct when skilled thoracic surgeons and excellent postoperative care are available (140, 141) .\n\nThe WHO consolidated guidelines include a conditional recommendation for elective partial lung resection (lobectomy or wedge resection) as an adjunct to the chemotherapy of MDR/RR-TB patients with resistance to additional medicines. The recommendation does not apply to radical pneumonectomy, which had no statistically significant effect (140) . The recommendation was based on evidence from an IPD meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of different forms of elective surgery as an adjunct to combination medical therapy for MDR-TB (140) , and a systematic review and study-level meta-analysis (142) .\n\nRecommendation 7.1: In patients with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) or multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), elective partial lung resection (lobectomy or wedge resection) may be used alongside a recommended MDR-TB regimen. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)\n\nThe relative benefits of surgery are expected to depend substantially on the population subgroups that are targeted. The reviews for the guideline update in 2016 (8) could not provide a refined differentiation of the type of patient who would be best suited to an intervention, or the type of intervention that would carry the most benefit. The effect is expected to be moderate in the average patient considered appropriate for surgery. The odds of success for patients with MDR/RR-TB and resistance to FQ and injectable agents were significantly lower when they underwent surgery compared with other patients ( aOR : 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2–0.9) (140) . This finding is likely to be biased, given that patients who underwent surgery would have had other factors predisposing them to poor outcomes – factors that could not be adjusted for. Programmes with limited access to surgery may target patients who remain sputum smear positive, who have resistance to many drugs and who have localized pulmonary disease. Computerized tomography, pulmonary function testing and quantitative lung perfusion or ventilation may have a role in the preoperative work-up.\n\nResection surgery should be timed to give the patient the best possible chance of cure with the least risk of harm. Thus, the timing of surgery may be earlier in the course of the disease when the patient’s risk of morbidity and mortality are lower (e.g. when the disease is still localized to one lung or one lung lobe). Generally, at least 2 months of therapy should be given before resection surgery, to decrease the bacterial infection in the surrounding lung tissue. Prognosis appears to be better when partial lung resection is performed after culture conversion. Even with successful resection, the total duration of treatment and the duration of treatment after culture conversion should be guided by the recommendations in Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 .","tokens_est":860,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Many programmes will have limited access to surgical interventions. In programmes with suboptimal surgical facilities and with no trained thoracic surgeons, resection surgery may increase morbidity or mortality. Specialized surgical facilities should include stringent infection control measures (given that infectious material and aerosols are generated in large quantities during surgery), mechanical ventilation and postoperative pulmonary hygiene manoeuvres . After resection, direct laboratory testing of the resection material (lung lesion) will be useful. If the results of laboratory testing differ between the resected material and other clinical specimens, the treating clinician may need to adjust treatment based on the results obtained from the resected material or other clinical specimens.\n\nThere are still many uncertainties about the role of surgery in MDR-TB treatment. All data available for the 2016 recommendations were from observational data from case series, which may be biased. For instance, it is likely that in choosing patients to be operated on there would have been systematic exclusion of patients deemed unfit for surgery and anaesthesia , such as older patients and those who were very sick with comorbidities (e.g. no patient with HIV in the dataset had undergone surgery) or extensive disease. There were not enough data on AEs, surgical complications or long-term sequelae – some of which may be fatal – to allow for a meaningful analysis. Conversely, the effectiveness of surgery may have been underplayed in the analysis because of the lack of a suitable control group.","tokens_est":457,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

In patients with TB meningitis, evidence from RCTs (144–148) showed lower rates of death, severe disability and relapse when patients received steroids with TB treatment. The mortality benefit increased with increasing severity of TB meningitis. AEs and severe AEs, including severe hepatitis, were lower in patients receiving steroids. In patients with TB pericarditis, studies showed a benefit to steroid treatment in relation to death, constrictive pericarditis and treatment adherence (149–156) .\n\nAlthough the evidence and the recommendations primarily relate to non-MDR-TB, these recommendations could also apply to patients with MDR/RR-TB, on the condition that the patient is still receiving the TB treatment regimen. Corticosteroids are immunosuppressive and therefore can weaken the body’s response to fight TB; hence, they should only be used if clearly indicated and if the patient is on an adequate effective regimen. If corticosteroids are used in an inadequate regimen, this could accelerate the patient’s deterioration. Oral treatment can be given, but when a more immediate response is needed, injectable corticosteroids are often used initially.","tokens_est":498,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

This is important because, globally, MDR/RR-TB treatment success rates remain low (only 63% in 2022). Coinfection with HCV further complicates treatment, because individuals are at increased risk of liver damage (hepatotoxicity) due to certain anti-TB medications (160) .\n\nThere is an overlap in the risk factors for both HCV and TB. Chronic viral hepatitis B or C can further negatively impact TB treatment by increasing the risk of drug-induced hepatotoxicity (161) . Fortunately, the development of short-course, oral DAAs has revolutionized HCV treatment, achieving cure rates exceeding 90%, with minimal side-effects (161, 162) .\n\nA recent systematic review identified limited direct evidence on co-administration; however, expert analysis suggests potential benefits. Co-administering treatment for MDR-TB and HCV may improve MDR-TB treatment success, reduce treatment failures and decrease LTFU (163) . Although data on HCV treatment outcomes from co-administration are scarce, the potential advantages of MDR-TB treatment outweigh the uncertainties. Therefore, co-administration is conditionally recommended for MDR/ RR-TB patients with confirmed HCV coinfection and delaying HCV treatment is discouraged (163) . The decision to administer both treatment regimens should be informed by knowledge of potential DDIs and patient preferences. Importantly, if HCV treatment is not available, this should not impede the initiation of MDR-TB treatment.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge limitations in the available data, particularly for pregnant women, PLHIV and children. Caution is advised when applying the findings to these groups. Currently, there are no official recommendations for HCV treatment in pregnancy; however, this is an evolving area, and emerging evidence will guide future development of treatment recommendations. Clinicians should make co-administration decisions based on individual patient factors, including a thorough understanding of potential DDIs and existing comorbidities. Transparency regarding the current evidence limitations is crucial when discussing treatment options with patients.\n\nSupporting patient adherence is vital throughout treatment, particularly considering the potential for shorter regimens . Health care providers should prioritize strategies aimed at enhancing adherence and empowering patients to successfully complete both treatment courses.\n\nIn summary, co-administration of MDR-TB and HCV treatment is the suggested approach for individuals diagnosed with MDR/RR-TB and HCV. Although there are some data limitations, the potential benefits of improving MDR-TB treatment outcomes outweigh the risks. Effective implementation should prioritize patient support and clear communication.","tokens_est":730,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Although no significant risks were identified in the available data, the active drug-safety monitoring ( aDSM ) framework should be used for promptly detecting, managing and reporting any suspected or confirmed drug toxicities.\n\nThere is a paucity of data on DDIs between HCV treatments that use DAAs and MDR-TB medicines. Based on the limited published data available, current evidence suggests minimal interactions; however, caution is still advised.\n\nIt is notable that bedaquiline, a key component of most MDR-TB regimens, may increase the risk of liver toxicity, particularly when co-administered with some HCV treatments. Additionally, some MDR-TB drugs (e.g. ethionamide/ prothionamide and clofazimine) may interact with specific DAAs (e.g. daclatasvir) by affecting how the body processes them, although this has not been definitively proven (72) .\n\nTo address the paucity of published data on DDIs between anti-TB medications and HCV DAAs, health care professionals rely primarily on two key information sources:\n\n• drug package inserts: these provide known DDIs for each medication; rifampin was the only anti-TB drug with established DDI studies, so the results of these studies were extrapolated to estimate potential DDIs for other anti-TB and HCV DAA combinations; and\n\n• the University of Liverpool HEP drug interaction tool (165) : this online resource aided in further evaluation and confirmation of potential DDIs; however, some anti-TB drugs (kanamycin, cycloserine , clofazimine, ethionamide and para- aminosalicylic acid) were not included in this database (162) .\n\nUsing these resources, health care providers can assess potential DDIs by considering various HCV regimens and their predicted interactions with individual TB drugs used in the treatment of MDR-TB. This approach facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of possible DDIs, thereby informing treatment decisions and enhancing patient safety. As research in this area continues to evolve, it is crucial to approach concomitant treatment of TB and HCV with caution. Health care providers should remain vigilant and use available resources and emerging evidence to guide clinical decision-making, ensuring the best possible outcomes for patients with both conditions.\n\nPotential DDIs were evaluated considering different HCV regimens and their predicted interaction with individualized TB drugs used for MDR-TB, as shown in Table 2.8.1 .","tokens_est":652,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

If digital patient records do not already exist, it is important that the programme managers consider their introduction, at least for surveillance and possibly also for case management (182) . If patient records are already digital, changes may be needed in the electronic recording and reporting system to allow individuals belonging to MDR-TB regimen cohorts of interest (e.g. shorter regimen, bedaquiline-containing regimens and operational research subgroups) to be identifiable, and for certain options to be included in the monitoring framework (e.g. addition of clofazimine and registration of ECG findings).

These estimates of MDR/RR-TB patients likely to be enrolled are based on current notification trends and an expected increase in line with national and subnational plans. The programme first establishes the number of MDR/RR-TB enrolments expected in the coming years, depending on the future increase in programme capacity (e.g. as part of a project supported by a grant from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria). Then, based on knowledge from surveillance, eligibility and estimated rate of scale-up , the programme defines different patient groups; for example, those expected to receive different variants of the longer MDR/RR-TB regimens and those likely to receive a shorter MDR/RR-TB regimen. When estimating the caseload to put on treatment, it is necessary to factor in not just eligibility, but also what would be feasible to achieve within a given time, to ensure that all elements are in place for starting and maintaining patients on treatment (e.g. training and provision of an adequate framework for patient monitoring and support). Associated programme and patient costs other than the medicines themselves usually dominate the total cost for both longer and shorter MDR/RR-TB regimens (e.g. treatment of AEs, hospitalization, diagnostic consumables, other clinical care and social support); however, total costs are expected to be lower for shorter regimens, given the shorter duration of treatment.","tokens_est":449,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

The NTP must ensure an uninterrupted supply of TB medicines through proper quantification, supply planning and rigorous quarterly monitoring, with a functional early warning system to avoid stock-outs and subsequent treatment interruptions. Similarly, other consumables (e.g. medicines for symptomatic relief and adverse reactions, syringes, diagnostic kits, medication for management of adverse effects, masks and N95 respirators) will be needed to ensure that the intervention is delivered as per internationally recommended standards (183) . The principles for the quantification of medicines needed for the longer and shorter MDR/RR-TB regimens are similar. The health care provider needs to have some basic details about how many patients will be treated and when they will start; the expected increment in caseload over successive years; the average body weight of the patients; whether children will also be enrolled; the expected losses (from interruptions, deaths and transfers to another regimen); and current stock on hand, including expiry dates and orders of medicines already in the pipeline and not yet delivered. It is best to split an order of medicines, the first part being for the patients expected to be started within 6 months, and the second part adjusted based on the actual enrolments. Technical assistance to strengthen the procurement and supply and to establish an early warning system for stock-outs can be accessed via the secretariats of the Global Drug Facility (GDF) and rGLC (which are housed in WHO regional offices) or via the WHO country offices. GDF provides support to many NTPs on the procurement and supply chain aspects of phase-in and phase-out plans of products or regimens and can procure child-friendly formulations. Childfriendly formulations allow more accurate paediatric dosing and are more acceptable to children and parents; they should be provided as the SoC wherever possible.","tokens_est":555,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

The programme must balance the need to provide access to new medicines for which the evidence is still incomplete with the need to protect patients from avoidable toxicity, the emergence of resistance to the new agents and observance of proper ethical conduct and respect for patient rights.\n\nGiven the increased use of newer and repurposed medicines in combination MDR-TB regimens, aDSM is particularly important. aDSM defines the active and systematic clinical and laboratory assessment of patients on MDR-TB treatment to detect, manage and report suspected or confirmed drug toxicities (16) . It applies the principles of active pharmacovigilance to the specific needs and context of NTPs, and is embedded within the routine patient monitoring function (e.g. treatment outcome cohort monitoring) of NTPs. The management of patient safety is an inherent part of aDSM , inseparable from its monitoring component. The recording and reporting activities of aDSM primarily target serious AEs as a priority requirement, but any AE during treatment administration ( whether or not it is related to drug toxicity) needs to be managed to limit harms to patients. MDR-TB treatment sites may also monitor nonserious AEs that are of clinical significance or of special interest to the programme , as part of more comprehensive aDSM . In aDSM , in addition to the spontaneously reported reactions, AEs are elicited as part of a patient monitoring plan that comprises a set of questions and often an array of laboratory or clinical tests at defined periods of time, before, during and after treatment ( Annex 3 ).\n\nTo ensure rapid uptake of the WHO-recommended shorter treatment regimens for TB, NTPs should take the lead on gathering a technical working group (TWG) from the representatives of affected communities and partners organizations to develop an introduction plan that defines all necessary measures and organizations responsible for implementation. Subsequently, the TWG , in collaboration with NTP, needs to coordinate the practical implementation of the planned activities. Table 2.9.1 presents a checklist of activities for considerations by the programme manager when planning and implementing the DR-TB regimens that are newly recommended.\n\nFor the successful introduction of a new regimen, the following needs to be achieved at the different levels of the NTP.","tokens_est":702,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Regular clinical assessments are critical to evaluate improvements in TB signs and symptoms, assess regimen effectiveness and prevent LTFU.\n\nIt is not always necessary to repeat radiological assessment during treatment because some radiological abnormalities may persist throughout and beyond treatment completion; hence, they may not indicate poor response or failure of treatment. However, radiological deterioration and new abnormalities (compared with baseline) may assist in identifying a poor treatment response. Therefore, radiological assessment should be repeated if clinically indicated.\n\nThere is growing evidence of resistance to both bedaquiline and linezolid in Mtb strains, particularly in patients who have been previously exposed to these medications. Reliable DST for bedaquiline, linezolid and all medicines included in the treatment regimen is crucial to understand the reasons behind a lack of bacteriological and clinical improvement. Ideally, DST for all medicines used in regimens should be accessible. However, this must not delay the initiation of life-saving treatment.\n\nBefore beginning a 9-month regimen, it is essential to have the patient’s bacteriological status, including confirmation of TB disease, MDR/RR-TB (at a minimum) and FQ susceptibility. FQ DST is also critical for tailoring appropriate 6-month regimens such as BPaLM / BPaL , BDLLfxC , BDLLfx or BDLC. This ensures efficacy while minimizing unnecessary toxicity. However, the lack of immediate FQ DST should not hinder the initiation of treatment, because regimens can be started with combinations that allow flexibility pending FQ DST results.\n\nNTPs should prioritize establishing baseline DST capacity for bedaquiline and linezolid, especially in patients with FQ resistance. Additionally, DST should be conducted on samples from patients with no bacteriological conversion after 4 months of treatment or in cases of recurrence while using 6-month regimens. Collecting strains for sequencing should also be considered as part of this effort.\n\nAll patients, and particularly children, should be followed up for clinical reassessment beyond treatment completion (ideally over a 12-month period) to monitor for potential relapse .","tokens_est":601,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

The modified 9-month regimen, BLMZ, is preferred over the 9-month regimen with linezolid owing to its limited drug count and history of use in pregnancy. Regular assessments should include fetal development monitoring, maternal health checks and drug-specific AE screening.\n\nFor breastfeeding women treated with shorter regimens, extra vigilance is needed to monitor infant health and potential drug exposure through breast milk. In both cases, adherence support and proper administration of MDR/RR-TB treatment are crucial. Care providers must ensure continuity of care between antenatal and TB services, which are often poorly integrated in high TB burden settings. Good communication between providers and the patient is critical to avoid unnecessary treatment modifications, reduce stigma and prevent LTFU.\n\nFor PLHIV, there are limited data but some promising results from current research.

However, its effects are often most devastating among the poorer and more marginalized members of a society . A person’s quality of life, social status and financial situation can be made worse both by the disease and by its treatment, namely: adverse drug reactions produced by the treatment, the high costs he or she may have to pay while undergoing care and treatment, having to miss work due to illness, and the stigma and discrimination linked to the disease. People who are poorer or have less social support may suffer these effects the most because they may have fewer resources to help them through the illness. The delivery of person- centred care and social support is essential to the management of TB and should protect human rights and support ethical standards, reducing the patient’s and family’s social and economic costs and using the most effective methods to prevent and treat the disease. Person- centred care and social support also contribute to improving the treatment outcomes and quality of life of people with TB . In many cases it also makes a difference in enabling the patient and family to access health care.\n\nThis chapter addresses the person- centred care approach to treatment administration and the social support framework for programmatic management of TB – both aimed at improving the quality of life of patients, enabling their adherence to treatment and reducing social and economic costs. The scope of the social support recommended in this operational handbook chapter includes several elements of the social assistance recommended in forthcoming guidance on social protection for people affected by TB.

People- centred approach\n\nIn view of the high burden of disease, death and suffering associated with TB, Standard 9 of the International standards for tuberculosis care (1) states: “A patient- centred approach to treatment should be developed for all patients in order to promote adherence, improve quality of life, and relieve suffering. This approach should be based on the patient’s needs and mutual respect between the patient and the provider”. In 2016, WHO advocated a people- centred care approach which is focused on, and organized around, the health needs and expectations of people and communities rather than focusing on patients or diseases (2) . As a result, a people- centred model of TB care was defined as “an efficient and integrated set of affordable, accessible and acceptable health services, provided in a supportive environment to prevent, diagnose and treat TB” (3) .\n\nA people- centred (also referred as person- centred in this section) approach recognizes that TB care should be designed to address the needs, values and preferences – and protect the rights of – the people who suffer from TB in order to ensure successful treatment outcomes and improve their wellbeing and financial risk protection. People- centred or person- centred care “reflects care that is holistic, individualised , respectful and empowering, and considers the person as central to the process of care, encouraging informed, shared decision-making and self-determination. It means that a person and a health-care provider work together, discussing care options, treatment risks and benefits, to reach collaborative care decisions. Rather than being a passive recipient of health-care , the person is an active participant.” (4) .\n\nIn contrast to a disease- centred approach where the focus was on medication treatment only, a people- centred approach also focuses on supporting people to overcome the social economic, cultural, legal and psychological difficulties that can affect their response to the diagnosis and treatment of TB. Through person- centred care, the patient with TB is the most important person in the care plan; therefore the social and personal needs and preferences of the patient – not just the immediate requirements of medical treatment – are also focused on. This approach should also allow people to know and use their patient rights and fulfil their treatment responsibilities while being treated with respect and dignity and having their values and needs reflected in their treatment and care whenever possible.\n\nPerson- centred care is defined as “providing care that is respectful of, and responsive to, individual patient preferences, needs and values, and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions”. Pillar 1 of the End TB Strategy (5) clearly endorses this approach which treats patients as the most important element when providing TB treatment.","tokens_est":725,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

People- centred approach (cont)\n\nA people- centred approach focuses on the overall well-being, choices, convenience and safety of the individual patient. Thus, it takes account of the social and personal circumstances of the person, and not just the immediate requirements of medical treatment (6) . A people- centred approach helps to build a partnership between the people suffering from TB and health care providers, allowing care to be adapted to individual patient needs with the goals of improving the ability of patients to take all their medications and curing them from TB. The ability of a person to take all their medications is influenced by a number of factors, namely: the person’s knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about the disease, the treatment and the health care system; family experiences and beliefs; economic concerns (e.g. the ability of a patient to pay the costs associated with treatment); the health care system’s ability to support the patient; and available community resources to deal with the stigma and discrimination surrounding TB. These concerns can be resolved by making sure that patients have the support they need to complete their treatment. The types of support are described later in the module.\n\nTB care is not just about the science of treatment but also about human rights and social justice. The ethical values recommended for TB programmes include equity, the common good, solidarity, reciprocity, the harm principle, trust and transparency, the duty to care, effectiveness, efficiency, proportionality, participation and community engagement, respect and dignity, autonomy, privacy and confidentiality (7) .\n\nFrequently, TB most strongly affects people who are already marginalized and can worsen existing inequalities and discrimination. The marginalized include persons who are homeless, persons who use drugs, persons living with HIV, people who are incarcerated, indigenous persons and undocumented migrants. These persons experience stigma and discrimination in their day-to-day lives and care must be taken to ensure that this is not worsened in the context of TB. In addition, health care providers should keep in mind that gender may also be a driver of stigma in people with TB (8) .\n\nThe violation of human rights of people with TB is well recognized (9, 10) . Persons with TB often experience stigma and discrimination in many areas of life, including work, social activities and family life. They may also have difficulties in following medical advice due to social, economic, cultural and legal reasons. Consequently, it is important that the health care services are aware of all the barriers faced by people affected by TB and provide appropriate and comprehensive social support to help them cope successfully with the hardships of treatment. TB stigma can be defined as the negative labelling or rejection of people with TB, and often also their families, due to stereotyping or other negative traits associated with TB and the affected communities. As a result of a diagnosis of TB, people may experience feelings of shame, self-hatred, guilt or blame which may affect their ability to accept the diagnosis and to follow their care and treatment plans.\n\nHealth care workers may also be prejudiced against people with TB, and this may affect their interactions with patients with TB. They may do things that further stigmatize these patients, either through how they interact with the patient, the language they use or even the practices that are built into the health care system. If health care providers are not well supported and TB services lack resources, the health care workers may feel undervalued, which may reinforce stigma and prevent them from delivering quality care. Fear of infection can also serve as a driver of stigma in health care workers and may have an adverse impact on their relationships with people affected by TB.","tokens_est":978,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Care and support interventions to enable TB treatment adherence\n\nEnsuring adherence to TB therapy is one of the important challenges for achieving a successful treatment outcome, particularly for patients with drug-resistant TB (DR-TB). This is because of the large number of medications, the frequent and serious adverse drug reactions, and the social and financial costs to patients related to TB treatment. Because DR-TB and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) treatment are often the last chance for treatment for many patients, and because there are serious public health consequences if treatment fails, it is important that all patients are supported using a person- centred approach to ensure full adherence to treatment (7) .\n\nGood adherence to TB treatment (taking all the medications at the correct time) is essential to prevent the development of resistance and increase the chances of cure. Taking all the medications for TB therapy is difficult, particularly for DR-TB, because treatment regimens can sometimes be long, the daily pill burden is high, there are frequent and serious adverse drug reactions, and access to care can cause social and economic costs to patients. A person- centred approach is needed to maximize treatment adherence and enable early intervention with patients who are not responding to treatment, who are not able to take their medications or who are having adverse effects from treatment. Optimal person- centred care consists of multiple interventions, including social support (informational/ educational, psychological and emotional, and material support), treatment administration options and digital adherence technologies. Staff education and support that allow health care workers to provide health education and counselling on TB disease and treatment adherence are strongly recommended. It is also recommended that all patients receive medicines under an appropriate treatment administration option and that they benefit from social support interventions that ensure full adherence to treatment, with a person- centred approach based on sound ethics and with respect for human rights.\n\nNTPs need to improve patient access to quality treatment adherence interventions and optimal treatment administration options. Although all people with TB should receive appropriate care and support interventions, particular attention should be paid to patients being treated for DR-TB because DR-TB treatment is often the last therapeutic option for many patients and there are serious public health costs if treatment fails.\n\nThe following recommendations from the WHO guidelines on TB care and support (15, 16) continue to apply to patients with drug-susceptible (DS) and drug-resistant (DR) TB.\n\nRecommendation 1.1 Health education and counselling on the disease and treatment adherence should be provided to patients on TB treatment.

Despite highly effective treatment, there are many psychological, social, medical and economic factors that can prevent people from accessing diagnosis, following care plans and successfully completing a course of treatment. The following is an adapted summary of how these factors may have an impact on psychological health, health-seeking behaviour and adherence (8) :\n\n1. Stigma, fear of discrimination, social isolation and lack of social support can affect screening, access to care and the ability to complete a treatment plan.\n\n2. The poorest and most marginalized communities that are at high risk of TB are also most likely to experience significant health and economic inequalities which further limit their access to care and treatment.\n\n3. The diagnosis of TB may cause distress and have an impact on self-worth that may affect patients’ sense of agency.\n\n4. Financial worries and limitations on everyday activities associated with TB (e.g. time off work) and its treatment (e.g. diagnostic and treatment costs, transport costs) add to the burdens on the patients.\n\n5. Long treatment duration may cause frustration and possible side-effects may make treatment intolerable or unpleasant, leading people to interrupt treatment.\n\n6. Life situations (e.g. financial challenges, a death in the family or marital difficulties) may have a negative impact on psychological health and on patients’ ability to take their medication.\n\n7. TB often presents with comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, HIV/AIDS) which may cause further difficulties for the patient.\n\n8. People with TB may also have mental disorders – such as opioid or alcohol use disorders or depression – that may complicate their ability to adhere to treatment or tolerate medication without additional support. Similarly, some TB medications may also worsen mental health conditions.\n\n9. Poor-quality medical care without rights-based, people- centred and respectful care can also add to the psychological burden of illness and treatment.\n\n10. When treatment fails, people grieve and may suffer and feel hopeless.\n\n11. Lack of support from services, friends and family may harm the patient’s emotional health.\n\n12. TB and its long-term treatment affect families and caregivers. Their anxieties and burden of work taking care of the patient can make it difficult to support treatment adherence, infection control and the patient’s needs over time.\n\nSeveral populations are particularly vulnerable to TB and at higher risk of having poor outcomes, namely: children, miners, migrant populations, people who are incarcerated, and people who suffer from opioid or alcohol use disorders. Health care providers who deal with vulnerable populations need to have skills to assess and respond to the psychological and social needs of these people when TB is detected (17) .\n\nSocial support is very important to a people- centred approach to improve the well-being of people infected with TB and to support treatment plans by addressing the barriers described above. Social support must be available for people throughout TB treatment, from diagnosis to the conclusion of the treatment.\n\nSocial support refers to the amount of perceived and practical care received from family, friends and/or the community (18) . It aims to provide care to patients to show that they are part of a social network that cares for them. Social support improves health outcomes and reduces death. Adding social support to the medication treatment regimens can improve treatment outcomes for people suffering from TB (15, 16) .\n\nSocial support is made up of four resources, namely (11) :","tokens_est":923,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Informational support is information or education that helps a person to solve problems and reduce stress; it includes training and education on the medications a person is taking, their possible side-effects, how treatment is monitored, and how the success of treatment is determined.\n\n2. Psychological (emotional) support refers to all types of care that strengthen self-esteem through understanding, trust, encouragement and care, and that help to deal with the psychological challenges in life.\n\n3. Material support includes financial support which could be money (e.g. grants from the government), food support, travel support or anything that helps the patient with the financial costs of TB disease and its treatment.\n\n4. Companionship support is help that makes a person feel that he or she belongs to the social system, and that he or she can rely on it for certain needs.\n\nCreating a way for the TB programme to deliver these four social support resources to patients, taking into consideration any specific age- or gender-sensitive concerns, is necessary for a personcentred approach that makes sure patients are doing well and can complete their TB treatment. The principles of social support described here should be ensured for vulnerable populations, including older persons, people who are incarcerated, internally displaced persons or refugees, people with substance use disorders, indigenous communities and ethnic minorities.\n\nMany programmes use a multidisciplinary “support to adherence” team (social workers, nurses, health educators, community treatment supporters and doctors).

As an example, the guide on the standardized package of community-based support services to improve TB outcomes describes many of the possible services for adherence support in detail (19) . Provision of information and education should begin as soon as diagnosis is made and should continue throughout the course of treatment. Patient information and education take place over several visits with different health care providers, including physicians, nurses and community health workers. Materials should be appropriate to the literacy levels of the patient, available in local languages and should be gender-, age- and culturally sensitive. Information and educational pamphlets with reminders of the main points, in the local language, are helpful. For patients with literacy limitations, efforts should be made to use e-health tools based on audio or visual support.\n\nPatients should also be provided with material to help them understand their rights in their local language (9, 10) . The Patients’ Charter for Tuberculosis Care also describes the responsibilities of patients and will help the provider to educate the patient about the disease, the treatment and the overall response of the government and civil society to the TB epidemic.\n\nThe NTP and all health care providers should use methods of “communicating with” (and not “talking at”) patients and their caregivers in a way that builds a positive partnership towards successful improved quality of life and treatment completion. For patients with literacy limitations, e-health tools based on audio or visual support should be used.\n\nAlthough implementing patient- centred high-quality TB care as outlined in the International standards for tuberculosis care (1) will often require additional time to be spent by health care workers, a lot can be achieved with simple changes in the attitudes and language used by health care providers and by communicating key information about the disease.\n\nThe ethical and person- centred approach of the End TB Strategy is to be reflected as well in the language used by all TB stakeholders, including health care providers. Language is a well-known method of exerting power and control. Words such as “defaulter”, “suspect” and “control” contribute to disempowering TB patients despite the good intentions of the health care providers. It is still not uncommon to find expressions such as “patient failed treatment”, which puts the blame only on the patient as if he or she were the only person responsible for failure of treatment. WHO has recommended replacing such language with words that are more respectful of patients and reflect better the values of the patient- centred approach to care that is now widely accepted in the TB community. Some examples include replacing “defaulter” with “person lost to follow-up”, “TB suspect” with “person with suspected TB” or “person to be evaluated for TB”; and “control” with ‘prevention and care’. This handbook and future TB documents of WHO are taking note of this suggestion to prevent derogatory and judgemental tones in the language used with patients and within TB prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care (20) .

As a result, there is immense distress that affects the quality of life of patients and that may also interfere with the way they follow their treatment.\n\nEmotional support usually refers to having close relationships with family and friends, with whom one can talk and feel loved and cared for. Psychological support is based on a skill set whereby trained personal can help alleviate distress. Psychological support tries to help with thought, emotional and behavioural concerns that may arise because of the stress of being diagnosed with TB, because of the treatment, or because of other life situations or stresses caused by TB. Informal psychological support can be provided by physicians, nurses, treatment supporters, family or community members by building a relationship with patients based on understanding and compassion to help them deal with psychological challenges in life, solve problems and lessen sources of stress. This kind of support may also help patients to follow their treatment plans and gain the skills needed to deal with stigma and discrimination. Details of techniques to provide psychological support are further discussed in Section 4.5 .\n\nFor formal psychological support – particularly if informal support is not successful, the impact of the challenges is severe or mental health problems are suspected (e.g. depression, substance and alcohol misuse, and persons experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder) – some TB patients may need to be referred to mental health services.

Therefore, it is essential to have a comprehensive assessment and referral system between TB, mental health services and community support.\n\nFormal methods of providing psychological support can be one-to-one counselling sessions or support groups assisted by counsellors.

These challenges can be successfully tackled through socioeconomic interventions, such as food baskets or transportation vouchers, that enable patients to complete the treatment and which usually work best when they are adapted to a patient’s specific needs. Some NTPs and health care providers have used these as enablers – i.e. as a means to help patients to address hurdles in taking medication and completing therapy. While enablers may improve outcomes, it is most important to use material support to overcome barriers that otherwise would be impossible for patients to overcome without some form of support.\n\nMaterial support can be services or commodities – e.g. financial support, food baskets, food supplements, food vouchers, transport subsidies, living allowance, housing enablers or cash transfer. This support helps patients or caregivers with the costs they face in order to obtain health services and tries to lessen the stress of income loss related to TB. At the beginning of treatment, the financial resources of the patient should be evaluated in order to support those in need of assistance using material support. The most support should be given to patients with the most need. Health care workers, treatment supporters, social workers or other professionals can help evaluate needs and make sure the material support reaches the patient. Cash transfers and microfinance support can improve household food security, which has been shown to increase access to health care. When prolonged hospitalization is necessary, supporting the patient and their family financially with a minimum “ livingallowance ” would be a helpful step under the patient- centred care approach.\n\nNutritional support is particularly important and can be part of material support. Not only does nutritional support help to lessen the financial stress of TB disease, but malnutrition/undernutrition can make TB disease worse, and TB can cause malnutrition. People who are malnourished/undernourished and who have TB disease are more likely to have worse outcomes and are more likely to die of TB than others. Children and pregnant/breastfeeding women are at particular risk from malnutrition. Treatment of malnutrition/undernutrition through material support should be considered just as important as other TB medications when managing patients with TB. Indeed, nutritional support should be included as part of a standard treatment and care plan for TB. Further details on nutritional care and support can be found in the Guideline: nutritional care and support for patients with tuberculosis (21) and WHO framework for collaborative action on tuberculosis and comorbidities (22) .\n\nThe involvement of civil society – such as patient support groups and nongovernmental organizations, as well as community- or faith-based organizations – is necessary to provide social support services. A more long-term way to provide material support to TB patients is to include all patients who qualify in the social protection programmes (such as unemployment benefits if the patient cannot work) that many countries have for vulnerable populations.","tokens_est":840,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

TB programmes can develop support activities that identify patients who have been cured (“community champion” or “ex-patient”) and provide them with training to be a peer supporter. This worker engages in support, treatment literacy and communication with other patients under treatment. These community champions or ex-patients should follow each patient from diagnosis through to cure, and they should act as both friend and educator. From the patient’s perspective, having this companion available reduces the psychological burden of the long duration of treatment and provides them with skills to cope with TB stigma and discrimination.\n\nPeer support groups, community champions or ex-patients and trained health workers can offer information-sharing sessions to educate patients, help with better detection of risk factors for default (e.g. understanding adverse effects of medication) and identify other warning signs that can affect treatment outcome.\n\nCompanionship support provides the basis for developing a social network within the care facility, which can play an essential role in improving rates of treatment completion.

Treatment support (an updated adaptation of directly observed treatment) is defined as another person (either a health care worker or a lay person) helping a patient with TB take his/her TB medications, providing emotional support and medically intervention (or recognizing when medical intervention is necessary) in the case of non-response to therapy or adverse effects from treatment. However, some subgroups of patients with factors affecting treatment adherence are more likely or less likely to benefit from certain forms of treatment support than other patients are; or certain types of delivery of treatment support (e.g. location of treatment support or type of treatment support provider) are likely to work better than others. Consequently, an assessment is required at the start of treatment in order to choose the most appropriate treatment administration option for each patient. Treatment provided closer to the patient normally offers convenience for the patient and, therefore, achieves better outcomes. Treatment support delivered at home or in the community, near the patient’s home or workplace, should be considered as the preferred options as they have shown better outcomes than treatment support provided at a health care facility, which is normally further away from the patient than the other options (15, 23) .\n\nThe TB treatment supporter should maintain strict confidentiality regarding the patient’s disease and treatment. In some cases, this may require working out a system whereby the patient can receive medication without the knowledge of others. The TB treatment supporter should be someone whom the patient is comfortable with. The TB treatment supporter should have the appropriate training and skills. Although evidence shows that treatment support by a health care worker, trained lay provider and family member displays advantages compared to unsupervised treatment, treatment support provided by trained lay providers and health care workers are the preferred options and the least preferred treatment support provider is a family member (15) .\n\nIn some settings and circumstances treatment support may be provided by health workers and in others by community members trained to deliver treatment for all forms of TB. While family-based treatment support has shown effectiveness in several settings, health care workers should be aware that family relationships can be complicated for the TB patient, and as a result either the patient or the family TB treatment supporter may encounter subtle manipulation or abuse that can jeopardize adherence to treatment, management of adverse drug reactions and access to social support services. Training and education for health care workers and treatment support providers are necessary to ensure the quality of treatment administration. Training and education can be done through many types of educational sessions, charts or visual reminders, educational tools and desktop aids for decision-making and reminders.\n\nWhen in-person treatment support is not possible for the patient and treatment provider, digital adherence technologies, such as video-supported treatment (VST), short message service (SMS), telephone calls or other means of communication can be considered when they are available and can be used by both health care providers and patients.","tokens_est":877,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Digital adherence technologies fit into the larger landscape of information technologies and are intended to help improve communication between patients and health care workers (25) . Three technologies have been studied in TB patients and are used to support treatment on a large scale, namely SMS or mobile text, event monitoring devices for medication support (EMMs) and VST for TB (26, 27) .\n\nSMS is a standard, built-in function found in all types of mobile telephones worldwide and is generally inexpensive and easy to use. It is thus widely applied for communicating with outpatients. SMS can provide regular, automated message reminders to patients to take their medications, can provide information related to their health or condition (unidirectional) or provide opportunities to interact as well (bidirectional). Most RCTs of SMS reminders in TB care in different geographical settings failed to show improved patient outcomes when compared with standard care. However, the control groups in these trials achieved high levels of adherence through varying scales of in-person support. The results also suggest that SMS could, to some degree, support adherence at times during treatment when in-person treatment support by a health care provider is not possible, thus increasing efficiency if not effectiveness. SMS could also be used when there is less necessity to see the patient face to face but there is still a need to keep in contact with the patient in case any concerns arise, such as during the continuation phase of treatment or when a patient has been on stable treatment for a long time without any problems. Research has yet to look more creatively at how SMS can influence adherence behaviour other than just by reminding people to take their pills, such as by channelling cash transfers when treatment milestones are achieved, by combining SMS reminders with other digital solutions and by targeting other points along the patient pathway. The popularity and affordability of SMS present a compelling case for further studies to investigate its potential more exhaustively. Instant messaging via installed mobile software may be used instead of SMS.\n\nEMMs aim to provide more patient flexibility when following up treatment; to support patients with dosing and refill reminders and instructions; and to compile patient-specific dosing histories to enable counselling and differentiated care. EMM boxes consist of automated electronic devices that record and inform the health care provider about the regularity with which a medicine container is opened. Older devices recorded usage on the container itself, but mobile telephones now allow patient reminders and alerts to be sent to the caregiver when medicine boxes remain unopened for a day or more. A large cluster-randomized trial showed a statistically significant effect of EMM boxes on adherence relative to the SoC; however, the effect on successful treatment completion was less clear (28) . Various technological advances with EMMs, such as requiring patients to dial in (to tollfree numbers) codes revealed when daily blister packs of medications are opened can be used to verify adherence. Under trial, a prototype brand of this technology – 99DOTS (29) – showed similar treatment completion rates when compared to the traditional adherence monitoring and support used by the sites, suggesting that this EMM could be a viable alternative to more labour-intensive forms of medication adherence monitoring (30) . Nonetheless, more evaluation is needed of the feasibility and utility of this technology (31) .","tokens_est":965,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

The increasing availability of Internet-enabled smartphones and tablet computers equipped with free or customized video communication software has increased options for both real-time (synchronous) and recorded (asynchronous) interactions. Observational studies and trials of VST for TB treatment from different settings suggest that the technique can produce similar outcomes to those produced by in-person monitoring and can improve efficiency (32–35) . Given the potential benefits of VST, studies are needed to evaluate it against different standards of care, including self-administered treatment, and to evaluate the acceptability of VST in different population subgroups and in more resourcelimited geographical settings.\n\nThe advantages of using VST are its potential to provide treatment support from a distance – and even when people travel and cannot visit or be visited by a TB treatment supporter. VST could help achieve better levels of patient interaction at a much lower cost and less inconvenience when compared with in-person treatment support. VST can be used in addition to, or interchangeably with, in-person treatment support or other treatment administration options.\n\nAnother option for providing care to patients when face-to-face visits are difficult is to schedule appointments to talk with them by telephone. Questions regarding treatment can be answered, symptoms can be monitored and counselling can be provided. Care should be taken to make sure that patients are able to find a place to talk where they have privacy. Also, if airtime is expensive, the length of time needed for these discussions may be too costly for the patient.\n\nThe performance of digital adherence technology under study conditions needs to be translated into programmatic realities. Health care practitioners and patients require practical aids that can adapt to a patient’s treatment course across a wide variety of different treatment conditions and at distinct time points when treatment interruption is more likely to happen. Technologies for treatment adherence support should be part of an integrated approach that complements the delivery of quality care. For instance, it is unrealistic and undesirable for patients on a longer DR-TB regimen to be placed on exclusive VST for 18–20 months. The risk of interruption is not uniform between patients or even during the treatment of the same patient. Treatment support therefore needs to be flexible throughout a patient’s course of treatment. Special attention is needed when there is a change in the treatment regimen which increases the risk of developing adverse medication reactions when: 1) the patient questions the need to continue the prescribed treatment as symptoms disappear and when she or he feels better; 2) conversely, when the patient may not be feeling better and may feel that treatment is hopeless; 3) when the patient travels far away from the usual treatment centre ; or 4) when other events affect a patient’s daily routine and make daily treatment more difficult.","tokens_est":797,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

On the basis of the different characteristics of each of the adherence support technologies and the patient’s individual situation, multiple options might be suitable. Two additional issues to consider are access to smartphones and to broadband Internet via mobile subscriptions. Smartphones and tablet computers, given their computing power and storage space, could be a valuable resource for multiple aspects of TB care. These can be useful even when broadband Internet is unavailable or erratic (e.g. recording of asynchronous VST, storage of patient medical records and e-Learning applications). SMS and EMM – which can operate without mobile broadband Internet coverage – are currently the most accessible, affordable and easily expandable treatment support approaches in resource-limited settings. Where mobile Internet is reliable and computer hardware available, solutions with more connectivity requirements can be considered as options.\n\nThe increasing range of technologies available for treatment support helps improve person- centred care. Nonetheless, digital technologies are still to be regarded as tools and should not replace face-to-face interactions when these are more appropriate. Another important consideration is that digital adherence technologies depend on the regular observation of a person’s behaviour in order to follow up adherence. This poses a number of ethical issues (7) . Some technologies may affect a patient’s privacy more than others – such as receiving a daily SMS text message that asks for a reply, the automated monitoring of the opening of a medicine box, or a video recording of a medicine being swallowed. The benefits of having recordings of patients taking their medications and the ability to text or speak with patients have to be balanced against potential downsides – such as patients feeling they are being controlled, a sense of being tracked and distrusted, loss of empowerment and concerns about confidentiality. These issues need to be discussed at length with the patients (see Section 4.1 on Guiding principles for health education and counselling). Further issues to consider when determining which treatment support technology may be best for a patient include the ability and willingness to learn to use the technology. Visual impairment and literacy may make it difficult for patients to use mobile telephones correctly. Another concern is that the cost of airtime or data may be too expensive for patients to use some of these technologies. Acceptability and preferences should be explored with each patient as part of her or his adherence plan.","tokens_est":722,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Overall, the principles for person- centred care and support (described in Section 2 ) should be followed.\n\nThe evidence reviewed and WHO recommendations suggested that a combination of appropriate care and support interventions improves outcomes for patients (15, 23) . Selecting appropriate interventions for each patient is very important and requires proper assessments and consultation with each patient to identify her or his needs and preferences.

Health education and counselling for people affected with TB\n\nThis section focuses on a key recommendation on patient care and support by providing health education and counselling on the disease and treatment adherence to TB treatment (15, 16) .\n\nRecommendation 1.1 Health education and counselling on the disease and treatment adherence should be provided to patients on TB treatment. (Strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence)\n\nThis recommendation is based on evidence from extensive literature which shows better rates of treatment adherence and completion, and lower rates of LTFU, in patients who received health education and counselling prior to and during the course of TB treatment (15, 23, 36–41) . Health education and counselling on TB and its treatment should be provided to all patients.\n\nThe goal of health education is to provide accurate information so that patients have the information to make the best choice for themselves. Education can be provided by talking with the patient, distributing written materials, sharing video recordings, or through arts and performance with participation of people affected by TB. The education should discuss TB as a disease, its treatment and the services for which the patient is eligible. The education can and should be given at multiple times during TB treatment both to remind patients of information and also to provide specific information for treatment changes that may be coming up. Education could occur right before or at the start of treatment, when finishing the intensive phase of therapy, or at each presentation or interaction for follow-up care. It can be provided by different types of health care workers or pharmacists. Educational sessions might include the patient alone or might involve the patients’ family members and/or friends. (15, 16) .\n\nWhile health education aims to equip people with the right knowledge, counselling helps them to apply that knowledge by changing their attitude and behaviour . The term “counselling” refers to a two-way interaction between the patient and the health care provider. It is an interpersonal, dynamic communication process that involves a kind of contractual agreement between a patient and a health care provider who is trained in counselling skills and who is bound by a code of ethics and practice. It requires understanding and concern for the patient without any moral or personal judgement. To achieve this, health care providers should be taught interpersonal skills in order to build a partnership with patients and to have good communication skills in order to talk with them and strengthen their understanding of TB. The goal is to make the patients feel strong enough to do what they need to do for treatment of their TB disease.","tokens_est":694,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

If possible, written information should also be shared. The goal of counselling is to make sure that people have understood the information and to answer any questions they might have. The health care provider should also correct any commonly held misconceptions or myths about TB.\n\nA person’s independence and right to choose should be respected. The health care providers should respect the patient’s choices and beliefs and not make decisions for the patient. All efforts should be made to involve the patient in making a treatment plan. WHO clearly states that every person affected by TB has the right to liberty and security of person and that involuntary detention, hospitalization or isolation of a person with TB is a deprivation of liberty and violation of the security of the person (9) . WHO also narrowly defines the circumstances in which this right can be overridden but makes clear that this must be for the shortest duration possible and in accordance with strict guidelines.\n\nSection 2 on the people- centred approach described how people suffering from TB might face stigma, prejudice or discrimination from the community as well as from health care providers. All efforts should be made to protect people from discrimination and to engage them in the most inclusive way. They should be treated with respect and dignity no matter what their age, gender, financial status, social situation, religion, sexuality or any other factors. In order to reduce stigma and discrimination, patients should be reminded that TB is not the result of any wrong behaviour and that most people completely recover after completing treatment.\n\nPeople suffering from TB should have personal privacy and confidentiality. It is important that they are seen in a private space for health counselling. They should be assured that information about their care is confidential and that it will not be shared with another person without the patient’s permission. Other family members should be invited to join the discussion only after receiving permission from the patient.","tokens_est":661,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

This partnership is the foundation that encourages people not just to participate in health education meetings, but also to engage in all aspects of treatment and care. Developing a trusting and caring environment is needed for this partnership, so that people are more likely to talk about their situation and concerns and receive necessary information. Forming a partnership allows for the sharing of information which is important to the process of counselling. Trust and a feeling of understanding should develop between the patient and the health care provider.\n\nUnderstanding is one of the most important elements in forming a partnership. A health care provider should try to understand a patient’s problems and feelings in a particular situation and should be able to communicate that understanding back to the patient. In order to build understanding, the health care provider should: 1) listen and observe carefully, without making judgements, in order to gather information; 2) focus and understand how the patient feels; and 3) talk with the patient to make sure he/she has been understood correctly. This is particularly important because it shows the health care provider’s sincere desire to help, develops a full understanding and provides an opportunity for the patient to explain further. This can be achieved by statements such as “it sounds as if the pain is unbearable.. ”. or “have I got it right that you are unable to sleep because of the cough” or “let me just check that...”.\n\nEmpathy is not the same as sympathy. Sympathy means, for instance, that a health care provider feels sad or becomes tearful when a person starts to cry. Understanding does not mean that a health care provider has to actually “feel” like the person. Instead, the health care provider has to “understand” how the person might feel (43) . For a complete understanding, health care providers should understand the cultural values and health beliefs of the patients they treat. They need to constantly check that they have understood what the patient explained. This might be a reason why patients continue to seek health advice from faith healers who share a better understanding of the patients’ experiences.\n\nMany of the skills of good communication are important when providing counselling – including active listening, the language used, gestures and body language, and showing genuine interest and care.","tokens_est":639,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

It requires intense concentration; the health care provider should show a deep interest in and respect for patients and should not interrupt them. In health counselling it is very important to listen to patients carefully so that the conversation can be adjusted to their individual needs.\n\nActive listening is more than just hearing someone else’s words; it means paying attention and showing that you have heard and understood what is being said to you. If health care providers can show that they really are listening, this increases the patient’s trust and confidence in the health care provider and the patient will feel more comfortable. This will make it easier to form a partnership.\n\nTo show that the health care provider has understood what has been said, it helps to repeat to the patient or summarize what has been said using different words. Paraphrasing or summarizing a patient’s responses or questions may also help to verify information. Some helpful examples of summarizing a conversation are:\n\n“Let me check if I have understood you correctly. You understand what TB is; you also understand about the treatment that has been recommended for you and why this treatment is so important for you. But you are worried about the side-effects of the medicines, especially because you will be taking these medicines for a few months, is that right?”\n\nThese skills also show the participation of the health care provider in the conversation. Another communication skill is called reflection. For example, if a patient is describing his or her concerns, the health care provider should observe the patient’s emotional reaction and then comment “It looks as if you are very worried about these symptoms.” Acknowledging a patient’s feelings also shows understanding and helps build an effective relationship.","tokens_est":493,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Health education and counselling for people affected with TB | 4.2 Effective communication skills to provide health education and counselling | 4.2.3 Using non-verbal communication","content_type":"text","pages":"223","text":"4.2.3 Using non-verbal communication\n\nNon-verbal communication includes eye contact, facial expressions, gestures, looking attentive, posture, nodding one’s head and other movements.\n\nNon-verbal communication also involves both the patient and the health care provider. The behaviour of the health care provider can give strong messages to show respect for and interest in the patient: It also builds a relationship, shows that the health care provider is listening carefully and shows that they want to help the patient understand about TB and treatment. Health care providers should use non-verbal communication to show that they are actively listening; this includes eye contact, smiling, nodding and sitting down while talking. The health care provider should avoid doing things like looking at their watch or fidgeting.\n\nA patient’s expressions also communicate emotions. Movements of eyes, mouth, eyebrows, forehead or even nostrils in different combinations signal happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, fear and interest. A slightly furrowed forehead will usually mean that the person either disagrees with what is being said or does not understand. That simple expression alone can show that they need more explanation. Because tension and anxiety may be reflected in body language, a reasonable guess at a person’s state of mind can be made simply from looking at their posture. People who are anxious or worried about something tend to adopt characteristically tense positions of the hands, which may be clasped tightly together, or of legs, which may be wrapped around each other or the feet may tap repeatedly on the floor. Often without the need for any words, these clues can alert an observant health care provider to investigate further.","tokens_est":441,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

In this situation, asking questions is important. A balance between “closed” and “open” questions can help to collect the necessary information in a short time.\n\nA closed question is one to which the only answer is “Yes” or “No”. Some examples are: Do you have a cough? Do you have fever? The trouble with using closed questions is that “Yes” or “No” often does not describe fully what the person wants to say.\n\nThat is where the “open” question has value. This type of technique lets people describe their experience in their own words. Open questions are short and suggest no specific answer. They begin with words like “What”, “Why”, “How” and are very short. Some examples are: How do you feel after you take your medicines? Why do you have trouble taking your medicines every day?\n\nIdeally, a problem should be explored with open-ended questions and then closed-ended questions should be asked in order to complete the information. Sometimes, however, people may go into\n\nunnecessary details and health care providers need to maintain some control over the interaction by gently moving on.","tokens_est":397,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Even medical information should avoid technical terms and medical jargon. Sometimes a limited amount of information is shared in one meeting so that the patient can understand it and then can think about it and is prepared for further information at the next meeting. Sometimes, important information needs to be repeated to help the patient understand it.\n\nHealth care providers should use language that is respectful towards patients and caregivers. It is important to not use derogative or judgemental language. Terms such as “defaulter”, “suspect” and “control” are disrespectful and disempowering. These are best replaced with “person lost to follow-up”, “person with suspected TB” or “person to be evaluated for TB”. The term “control” can be replaced by “prevention and care”. Similarly, expressions such as “patient failed treatment” or “failed to comply” reflect the view that the patient is to blame for the failure of treatment (44) .\n\nThe volume and tone of the voice of the health care provider is also important during health counselling. A very loud volume might be intimidating, and a very low volume may be difficult to hear or may give the impression that the health care provider is unsure of him/herself. Similarly, if the health care provider is speaking too fast, it seems as if they are in a rush and can also be difficult to understand.

These need to be practised by health care providers before they can share the information outlined above as part of health education and counselling.\n\n1. It is important to form a partnership with the patient before sharing any information. All efforts should be made to have a two-way conversation, rather than the health care provider just telling the patient facts. Patients should be encouraged to ask questions, information should be repeated to help them understand, and health care workers should check whether the patients have understood the information by asking short questions. Taking time to make sure that patients understand leads to better treatment outcomes.\n\n2. The first question should be: “What do you already know about TB?”\n\nOnce a health care provider has found out what a patient already knows about TB, the health care provider can focus the discussion on what the patient still needs to know.\n\n3. The next question should be: “What questions do you have about TB?”\n\nThe information about TB can then be personalized to the patient. For instance, it is quite possible that a patient is more interested in treatment options than the cause of TB. Once patients’ questions have been answered, they may be more ready to discuss other important TB subjects. Sometimes, it might be difficult to give all the necessary information during one meeting, so the health care provider needs to prioritize the information so that the most important questions are answered first. 4. Next the health care providers need to ask themselves: “What is the most important information that the patient must understand?”\n\nThe health care provider should focus on this most important information during the first educational talks with the patient. The health care provider should still encourage questions from patients and help them understand information by repeating it or asking them short questions.\n\nQuestions like “What do you know about your rights?” will communicate better with patients instead of reading them a list of their rights.\n\n5. Finally, health care providers should summarize the gaps and mistakes in the patient’s knowledge about TB.\n\nWhile respecting a patient’s religious beliefs, it is important to explore their health beliefs – particularly those that might make it difficult for the patient to finish treatment. These questions also help to the health care provider to understand what patients think about their illness or treatment, especially in their cultural context. Most people already have some understanding of TB because it is a common illness. They might also be anxious about their diagnosis or have some worries about the health care provider and the treatment. These concerns, beliefs and worries must be dealt with as part of health education and counselling. Families may also have their own ideas which might or might not be shared by the patient. Since families have a strong influence on patients’ behaviour , their views also need to be taken into account . This helps to avoid confusion within families with regard to medical advice. The importance of exploring a person’s health beliefs is also relevant to Section 5.4 on counselling for treatment adherence.\n\nIn addition to sharing information during visits, educational pamphlets that clearly state facts about TB and its treatment are very helpful. The educational material should be appropriate for all ages, culturally sensitive, presented in local languages and in reader-friendly formats. Digital tools with audio or visual aids are also likely to help patients who may have difficulty reading. Additionally, specific marginalized populations may require special educational efforts.","tokens_est":979,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

In addition to following the principles of effective communication in Section 5.2 , these guidelines should be followed:\n\n1. Distressed people may not always give a clear account of their situation or may take longer to explain themselves. They should be listened to patiently, without interrupting or rushing them. Asking for clarification usually helps. Sometimes, they might find it difficult to open up their feelings; being there and reassuring them is important. If they describe their feelings or difficult experiences, responding with empathy and sensitivity can help. Some examples of responses are:\n\nThat sounds like a very challenging experience.\n\nI understand how painful this has been for you.\n\nI can see why you are so worried (or frightened).\n\n2. Sources of stress should be identified. After actively listening and allowing the person to speak without interruption, following questions may be needed:\n\nWhat is your biggest worry these days?\n\nHow do you deal with this worry?\n\nWhat are some of the things that give you comfort, strength and energy?\n\n3. Their basic needs should be assessed. If they need more information or additional services, simply establishing contact with their family and providing other social support is important.\n\n4. Education should be provided about the normal stress reactions of people diagnosed with TB or experiencing difficulties with treatment or services.\n\n5. If the stress reaction is long or severe, specific stress management techniques should be offered (54) .\n\n6. The health care provider should look for potential signs of sexual or physical abuse (including domestic violence) in women, children and older people (e.g. unexplained bruises or injuries, excessive fear, overly withdrawn behaviour , reluctance to discuss matters when a family member is present, malnourishment in a family with access to sufficient food). When signs of abuse or neglect are present, the patient should be interviewed in a private space and asked if anything hurtful is going on. If abuse or neglect is strongly suspected or confirmed, help should be requested from colleagues with experience of dealing with this. If the patient gives consent, he/she should be referred to relevant community resources for protection (e.g. trusted legal services and protection networks).","tokens_est":619,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Some example questions are:\n\nWhat comforts you when you are upset?\n\nDo you talk to anyone about your problems and what you are going through?\n\nIs there any person who you feel can give you support?\n\nWho do you feel most comfortable sharing your problems with? When you are not feeling well, who do you turn to for help or advice?\n\nHow is your relationship with your family? In what way do your family and friends support you and in what way do you feel stressed by them?\n\n3. Then identify people who could provide support, such as trusted family members, friends and community members, and talk about how each one can be involved in helping.\n\n4. If the patient is willing, he/she should be referred to other community resources for companion or material support. These include: social or protection services; community centres ; self-help and support groups; employment and or other income-generating activities; formal/informal education; shelter, food and non-food items; child-friendly spaces. When making a referral, the patient should be helped to access them (e.g. provide directions to the location, operating hours, telephone number) and provide the patient with a short referral note.","tokens_est":367,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Counselling at the end of TB treatment is necessary to provide people with necessary information on the possibilities of post-TB symptoms, disability or sequelae, or the recurrence of TB; they need to access health care services for follow-up examinations when necessary. The process of counselling should continue to support people to adjust to their health challenges until they are emotionally stable.

Allow the patient to express strong emotions such as sadness, tearfulness or anger without interrupting or judging.\n\n2. Express the wish that there were some means to treat the illness.\n\n3. Assure patients that they will continue to be cared for, that they will be accompanied throughout the illness and that any discomforts will be treated.\n\n4. Ask whether the patient would like spiritual support and arrange for an appropriately trained spiritual supporter if requested by the patient.\n\n5. Assess the patient for symptoms of anxiety or depression. If these symptoms are in excess of what would normally be expected in this situation, consider treating. Refer for mental health services only if such services are easily and quickly accessible by the patient.\n\n6. Prior to the patient’s death, assess family members for bereavement risk (e.g. history of mental illness, difficult and emotionally charged relationship with the patient) (58).\n\n7. Make bereavement support available to the family via the palliative care team, a communitybased bereavement support group, or a social worker (59) .\n\n8.

Refer to a mental health specialist if suspected (58) .\n\n9. Implement resilience-promoting programmes within palliative care or DR-TB teams such as regular sharing of difficult cases, memorial ceremonies for deceased patients, regular social activities.\n\nProvide information and education to patients, as follows:\n\n1. Educate the patient about common reactions to disability or terminal conditions. The following statements are some examples:\n\nPeople in similar situations may react in different ways. Some people show strong emotions while others do not.\n\nIt is all right to feel sad and even cry; it does not mean you are weak.\n\nPeople who do not cry may feel the emotional pain just as deeply as others but have different ways of expressing it.\n\nThere are no right or wrong feelings. Sometimes you might feel very sad, and at other times you might feel better.\n\n2. People who suffer from debilitating complications after treatment may also experience adverse psychosocial and financial impacts. It is extremely important to monitor their adjustment to compromised health status; it may take up to 6 months before they are able to recover their emotional health completely. During this period, other forms of social and occupational support can be of tremendous help.\n\n3. Health care providers also need to be mindful of patients’ cultural and religious beliefs. Spiritual distress and existential concerns should be treated with the same level of priority as psychosocial distress and physical pain. Support may involve a spiritual caregiver.","tokens_est":976,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Care could occur at local centres (e.g. community centres ), or at the patient’s home or workplace. Having treatment and care provided in decentralized health care centres is a good way to improve access to treatment and increase the number of patients who receive regular, community-based treatment and support. Decentralized care is often less disruptive to patients’ lives, allowing them to access treatment, care and counselling more easily and with less cost. It may also allow them to continue to work (therefore lessening the financial burden of TB disease) and to remain with their families. Decentralized care can be used for patients with either DS-TB or DR-TB. According to the WHO guidelines, all-oral regimens are preferred for TB treatment (61 –63) ; however, if the patient must receive injectable medication, it should be investigated whether the injectable can be given at a decentralized location (60–62) .\n\nDecentralized care may not be best for all patients. Of particular concern would be patients with severe TB disease or severe comorbidities or very infectious forms of TB. However, studies have shown higher rates of treatment success and fewer patients lost to follow-up when patients were treated with decentralized care versus hospital-based care (64) . There were no higher risks of death or treatment failure among patients who were treated with decentralized care. Before a patient begins decentralized care, the health care provider needs to make sure that all required safety monitoring (e.g. laboratory tests, ECG) can still be done in the decentralized system or that, when needed, a patient can travel to a clinic or hospital with a higher level of care that can do this monitoring. There should always be a plan to get patients to a hospital if they need inpatient treatment. This may be necessary in certain patient groups at particular risk, such as children with severe forms of TB or people who also have advanced HIV. These patients may need close monitoring in a hospital for a certain period of time .\n\nThe backbone of community-based TB care is often a community TB treatment supporter, who may belong to the neighbourhood where the patient lives (53) . Community TB treatment supporters, like all health care workers, must respect and preserve patient confidentiality at all times . They can also play an important role in educating the community about TB and can help reduce stigma around the disease. Community-based TB providers need to be properly trained and supervised by qualified health care workers (65) . In some settings, and where there are no other alternatives, a communitybased TB treatment supporter can even be a family member who has undergone proper training and is supervised by a health care worker or qualified community member. However, family relationships can be complex, and so the nature of family relations should be evaluated beforehand to ensure that the patient receives fully supportive care.","tokens_est":823,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

This is likely to require additional help from the NTP. Clinic staff must be aware of the early detection and management of adverse drug reactions and should be familiar with social support services. When patients are on good medical treatment, the bacterial load rapidly falls and the risk of transmission of TB drops. Nevertheless, infection control measures need to be put in place at the clinic. The patients also need to be educated on infection control measures they can do at home, particularly if they live with someone who is at a particular risk from TB infection, such as a young child or someone living with HIV. These infection control measures will decrease the risk of transmission in households, the community and clinics. In the case of a patient with DR-TB, it may be illegal in some countries to treat DR-TB patients in a decentralized setting, especially when the treatment involves injections. Such legal concerns need to be considered when making plans for decentralized versus hospital-based care (see Box 3 ).\n\nThis decentralized model of care may require the patient to travel from home and receive medicines under person- centred treatment support at the clinic.

This is the case, for instance, if a patient has a severe form of DS-TB or DR-TB disease (e.g. meningitis, vertebral bone infection, pericarditis, miliary TB or severe TB lung disease with signs of respiratory distress/failure or sepsis), has serious comorbidities (e.g. severe malnutrition, untreated HIV, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus), is either very young or quite old, or has serious adverse reactions to medication (66) . In these cases, the patients may need to be hospitalized until these conditions stabilize. In the past, patients with DR- TB, were routinely kept in hospital until the end of the intensive phase of treatment or until conversion to smear/culture-negative status. Long hospitalization should not be routinely required for patients on DR-TB treatment unless it is absolutely medically necessary. The treatment regimen should rarely require a patient with DR-TB to be hospitalized because every attempt should be made to put the patient on an all-oral regimen that they can receive as an outpatient. Additionally, a patient should be kept in isolation while hospitalized only when no other options remain.\n\nBox 4 lists things to consider when a patient must be hospitalized. Hospitalized patients should have access to all the social support services they need (see Section 3.1 ).

Therefore, in real-life circumstances, multiple models of care may be used depending on the needs of the patient and the resources of the health care system.\n\nSome patients may need hospital-based care (inpatient model) either while receiving complicated treatment or when on end-of-life care. This is because hospitals play a very important role in the clinical management of severe TB disease and DR-TB. This includes: treatment of TB comorbidities (such as HIV or noncommunicable diseases (e.g. diabetes, severe mental health disorders); surgical treatment of selected TB patients; management of severe adverse drug reactions (particularly to second-line anti-TB drugs); treatment of pulmonary complications in patients with severe TB disease; medical support during palliative and end-of-life care; and the initial care of patients who are homeless, have difficult family situations, or who live in remote areas where TB care is difficult or DR-TB care is not yet available.\n\nHowever, in some settings, depending only on an inpatient model of care may result in problems, namely: it may slow down or even make it impossible to get all patients into treatment due to the high costs of hospital care; create long patient waiting lists due to the lack of hospital beds; cause longer than necessary suffering of patients with TB; and create catastrophic costs for patients. An outpatient system must be in place to support patients upon discharge even in settings that rely mainly on a hospital-based model. Thus, the ability to provide ambulatory TB care has to be built into whatever model is used.\n\nWhen comparing different treatment models, a number of issues have to be considered (see Box 5 ) and ethical concerns need to be respected. While outpatient care is often socially more acceptable to patients and reduces health system costs, the creation of outpatient person- centred treatment support is challenging. It requires access to a primary health care network, strong social support and community-based care. However, in some settings, the community-based decentralized model of care is the only way to achieve universal access to treatment.\n\nWhichever model is chosen to provide treatment for TB, a multidisciplinary team of providers – including physicians, nurses, psychologists, social workers and community health workers or volunteers – should be involved in care. The roles and responsibilities of each of these groups of providers will vary depending on the needs and resources available in specific settings.\n\nAdherence to TB treatment – particularly DR-TB treatment – is challenging and therefore social support and social protection measures to improve adherence should be used, whichever model is chosen (see Section 3.1 ).\n\nThe risk of TB (with particular concern for DR-TB) transmission when proper infection control measures are not being used occurs in all models of care whenever the patient remains sputum smear-/ culturepositive . However, the risk is particularly serious in the hospital-based model where the adverse effects of transmission could be higher (hospitals are crowded so it is easier to infect more people, and those people are likely to have other serious illnesses as well). This is a critical factor to consider when selecting a model of care for a DR-TB patient.","tokens_est":958,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Care at higher levels in the health system is often managed in a vertical, non-integrated way. Children and adolescents with TB may go undetected because of missed opportunities for contact investigation, TB prevention, detection and care, and as a result of weak integration of child and adolescent TB services with other programmes and services – especially the integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI), malnutrition and HIV services. If not addressed, such access challenges contribute to preventable delays in diagnosis and treatment, which may lead to increased disease severity, suffering and mortality (69) .\n\nAn important step towards improving access to TB prevention and the management of TB in children and adolescents is the provision of decentralized, family- centred integrated care (67) . Integrated, person- centred care and prevention is a key pillar of WHO’s End TB Strategy and aims to ensure that all people with TB have access to affordable high-quality services according to their needs and preferences (5) . This is further underpinned in the 2018 WHO roadmap towards ending TB in children and adolescents (67), which calls for the implementation of integrated family- and community- centred strategies.\n\nThis section focuses on models of care to increase access to TB services for children and adolescents through family- centred , integrated care. Family- centred models of care refer to interventions selected on the basis of the needs, values and preferences of the child or adolescent and their family or caregiver. This can include health education, communication and material or psychological support. Integrated services refer to approaches to strengthen collaboration, coordination, integration and harmonization of child and adolescent TB services with other child health-related programmes and services. This can include integration of models of care for TB screening, prevention, diagnosis and treatment with other service delivery platforms for maternal and child health (e.g. antenatal care, integrated community case management, IMCI) and other related services (e.g. HIV, nutrition, immunization). Other examples include the evaluation of children and adolescents with common comorbidities (e.g. meningitis, malnutrition, pneumonia, chronic lung disease, diabetes, HIV) for TB and community health strategies that integrate child and adolescent TB awareness, education, screening, prevention and case-finding into training and service delivery activities.\n\nThe following are the WHO recommendations on decentralized and integrated family- centred models of care for TB services for children and adolescents (70) .\n\nRecommendation 3.1 In TB high-burden settings, decentralized models of care may be used to deliver TB services to children and adolescents with signs and symptoms of TB and/or those exposed to TB. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)\n\nRecommendation 3.2 Family- centred , integrated models of care to deliver TB services may be used in children and adolescents with signs and symptoms of TB and/or those exposed to TB, in addition to standard models of care. ( Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)\n\nRemarks\n\n1.

The recommendations apply to children and adolescents with signs and symptoms of TB in terms of the impact on case detection. They also concern children and adolescents who are exposed to TB (i.e. TB contacts), and who are eligible for TPT, in terms of the impact on provision of TPT. Children and adolescents with signs and symptoms who need evaluation for TB disease may also have a history of exposure to TB (i.e. TB contacts). Children and adolescents who are TB contacts and who do not have signs and symptoms should be evaluated for TPT eligibility.\n\n3. The recommendation on decentralized services refers to enhancing child and adolescent TB services at peripheral levels of the health system where they are closer to the community, and not to replacing specialized paediatric TB services at higher levels of the health system.\n\n4. Decentralization should be prioritized for settings and populations with poor access to existing services and/or in high TB-prevalence areas.\n\n5. Family- centred , integrated approaches are recommended as an additional option to standard TB services (e.g. alongside specialized services that may have a limited level of integration with other programmes or links to general health services).\n\n6. Family- centred care is a cross-cutting principle of child care at all levels of the health system.\n\nThese approaches on decentralization and family- centred integrated care aim to bring TB services closer to where children, adolescents and families live. As the recommendations were published in 2022 (70) , evidence on the best ways to implement these recommendations is emerging, and national programmes are encouraged to document examples of best practice in this area.\n\nDecentralization includes the provision of access to or capacity for child and adolescent TB services at a lower level of the health system than the lowest level where it is currently routinely provided. In most settings, decentralization applies to the district hospital level (first referral level), the primary health care level or the community level. Interventions to facilitate decentralization include capacitybuilding of various cadres of health care workers, access to diagnostic services, availability of TB medicines for children and adolescents, and follow-up of children and adolescents with TB or on TPT.\n\nSince children and adolescents who are unwell commonly seek care at the primary health care level, where TB services are not always available, decentralization and integration of such services using a family- centred approach has the potential to improve access to care, especially for children and adolescents who do not need referral to a higher level facility. The objectives of decentralization are closely linked to the aspirations of universal health coverage (all people have access to the health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship), which is a strategic priority for Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 3.8 (71) .\n\nDecentralization of care at the community level has the following advantages:\n\n• increased equity via improved access to health services;\n\n• provision of TB care at the same time and in the same place for all family members;\n\n• savings in time and money when care is provided closer to home;\n\n• continuity of care between the person’s home, community and local health centre ;\n\n• increased community support, which may lead to better adherence to treatment and can be instrumental in overcoming barriers to long-term care, including treatment adherence, transportation costs, missing school and loss of wages during sickness and clinic visits.","tokens_est":938,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

For instance, opportunities for the integration of TB services at the health facility level exist in outpatient departments; nutrition, HIV, maternal and child health clinics (e.g. prevention of mother-to-child transmission, antenatal care, immunization clinics); general paediatric , adult TB and chest clinics; and inpatient departments. If resources are available, the NTP may consider implementing providerinitiated TB screening in relevant child health entry points, and linkages to diagnosis or treatment. If resources are limited, entry points or services designed to care for sick children could be prioritized.\n\nThe WHO policy on collaborative TB/HIV activities recommends the delivery of integrated TB/HIV services, preferably at the same time and location (76) . The policy further recommends that HIV programmes and NTPs should collaborate with other programmes to ensure access to integrated and quality-assured services, including for children and adolescents. Quality statement 1.8 of the Standards\n\nfor improving the quality of care for children and young adolescents in health facilities recommends that all children at risk for TB or HIV are correctly assessed and investigated and receive appropriate management according to WHO guidelines (77) .\n\nMany health care providers at the primary health care level in high TB burden countries have been comprehensively trained on assessing and caring for children with pneumonia, diarrhoea and malnutrition using IMCI and integrated service delivery packages on community case management. These packages are centred on the most common childhood illnesses, such as pneumonia and malnutrition, which have a clinical presentation similar to TB (78, 79) . Therefore, they offer an opportunity to strengthen integrated symptom-based screening for TB in sick children aged under 5 years. Specifically, the 2014 WHO IMCI chart booklet (79) caters for referral of children with a cough for more than 14 days, assessment of TB infection among children with acute malnutrition, and TB assessment and TPT among children living with HIV (78, 79) .\n\nSeveral considerations for the implementation of decentralized and integrated family- centred models of care for children and adolescents are included in the WHO operational handbook on tuberculosis.

Treatment adherence interventions that may be offered for people on TB treatment may include material support (e.g. food, financial incentives, transport fees), psychological support, tracers such as home visits or digital health communication (e.g. SMS, telephone) and medicine monitoring (15, 16) . Interventions should be selected on the basis of assessment of the individual’s needs and preferences as well as available resources.

Most children with TB develop it after contact with an adult family member with active infectious pulmonary TB (PTB). A high number of TB notifications in children indicates an ongoing adult epidemic (80) . TB in the family threatens household income and financial security.\n\nSome examples of the impact of TB on children include dropping out of school following parental bereavement from TB or leaving school to go to work to maintain household income (81) . TB in childhood or adolescence may also disrupt or delay schooling and impair growth (82) . A recent scoping review reported that time spent caring for a child with TB had impacts on family spending, nutrition and education, and overall reduced household income – all of which were associated with lowered family well-being. In addition, perceived and enacted stigma had practical implications for TB diagnosis, clinic attendance and treatment, and other psychosocial impacts beyond stigma, including breakdown of parental relationships. School disruption, food insecurity and a lack of social protection have also been reported for children and adolescents with TB based on an analysis of national TB patient cost surveys.","tokens_est":349,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Services may be provided at different levels of the health system, depending on the availability of comprehensive primary care and the degree of decentralization of the respective services. In some settings, TB services may be decentralized to the primary care level, while services for comorbidities such as diabetes and mental disorders may be available only at the secondary care level. In this situation, the degree of integration can be increased only if diabetes and mental health services are also decentralized closer to the end user (22) . The provision of integrated care and comprehensive services for people with HIV-associated TB as close as possible to where they live has long been a focus of WHO policy documents. Such efforts should include integrating services for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care of TB and HIV into maternal and child health services, including the prevention of parentto -child transmission of HIV, and treatment centres for drug dependency where applicable (76) .\n\nWithin these models, care may be provided by separate specialist health care workers who refer patients to different services according to established pathways. Alternatively, multidisciplinary teams comprising professionals with a mix of skills, including medical and nonmedical , that are required to meet the needs of the end user, may provide coordinated care (85) . Care can also be provided by one health care worker for both TB and comorbidities, where the expertise is available (e.g. for TB and HIV) (84) .

A wide range of private health care providers exist in different settings, and the services they provide vary. It is important for NTPs to recognize the different private health care providers in the community and work with them to improve the services TB patients are receiving. Private health care providers should particularly be educated on TB – including TB prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment and care – and should understand the importance of mandatory reporting (67) .

There has been a large global drop in the number of people newly diagnosed with TB. Reduced access to TB diagnosis and treatment has resulted in an increase in the number of TB-related deaths.\n\nIndirect impacts of health emergencies, such as reduced household income, increased poverty, food insecurity, malnutrition, missed health checks, missed vaccinations and missed work or schooling, may affect TB diagnosis and care.\n\nIn May 2021, WHO updated its information note on COVID-19 – considerations for tuberculosis (TB) care to guide countries on approaches to maintaining TB services (89) . For instance, both COVID19 and TB have respiratory symptoms, which provides an opportunity to diagnose both COVID-19 and TB (90) .\n\nProgrammes should make sure that there are enough stocks of TB preventive therapy for the predicted increased need for this therapy resulting from people with undiagnosed TB and increased associated exposure because of COVID-19-related lockdowns. NTPs should ensure that supplies of TB medicines are not interrupted and that people with TB are provided with adequate refills to enhance treatment completion and minimize frequent trips to health facilities, where there may be an increased risk of infection from COVID-19.

Palliative care should be initiated immediately as needed and should be combined with TB treatment to relieve any suffering due to the disease, to the adverse effects of treatment, to comorbidities or to social problems. It is especially important for people with DR-TB (98) . Tailored to the patient’s needs, palliative care should continue regardless of whether the cure is expected or whether treatment fails. It should be available at all levels of the health care system (94–96) , namely:\n\n• TB and lung disease hospitals and general hospitals with TB units;\n\n• district hospitals;\n\n• TB clinics in the community;\n\n• patients’ homes.\n\nEven when a patient recovers from TB disease, all the medical effects of TB may not be resolved. People that survive TB may have long-term impairment from TB disease (99–102) . People who had bone or neurological infections may continue to have problems related to bone damage or neurological issues. It is also becoming more and more recognized that even people who had pulmonary TB may have serious long-term medical problems resulting from lung damage resulting from TB. Studies find that a majority of patients report respiratory symptoms after completing TB treatment. Patients may have continued shortness of breath, cough, decreased lung function, bronchiectasis and recurrent bacterial pneumonia. They may also develop heart failure due to lung damage. These symptoms often continue to affect their daily lives. Although many people improve with time, a significant number continue to have symptoms, and their symptoms may even worsen with time.\n\nIt is important to continue to monitor the health of TB patients even after they have finished their medications for TB disease. They may need to be followed by a lung or heart doctor to help treat ongoing symptoms. They may benefit from palliative care which can offer treatments to help with their symptoms such as shortness of breath, swelling from heart disease, pain and psychiatric care to help patients who are facing long-term health problems.","tokens_est":554,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Continuing them while the treatment is failing may cause additional unnecessary suffering and create false expectations in patients and families.\n\n• Public health: Patients in whom DR-TB regimens fail are likely already to have highly resistant strains, and ongoing therapy can result in resistance to even more medications. The resultant highly resistant strains could subsequently infect others and be extremely difficult to treat. In addition to the creation of further resistance, continued treatment in this situation also uses resources that may be very scarce. Thus, in general, treatment should be discontinued in this situation. However, if there is no clinical deterioration and the clinician prefers to continue the regimen, strict respiratory infection control is critical.\n\n• Non-abandonment: Provision of palliative and end-of-life care is imperative to optimize the quality of life with proper TB infection control (16, 91) .","tokens_est":297,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

If the clinical team decides together that treatment should be suspended, a clear plan should be prepared for approaching the patient and the family. This process usually requires personal interaction with patient and family, ideally including home visits, and may take several weeks. It is not recommended to suspend therapy before the patient understands and accepts the reasons to do so, agrees with a change in goals of care to optimizing quality of life and comfort, and accepts palliative care. It is crucial that care continues and that the patient not be abandoned.\n\nBox 6. Checklist of essential palliative and end-of-life care\n\nÎ Is relief from dyspnoea offered? Oxygen may be used to alleviate shortness of breath in some cases, but there is no significant evidence to generalize its practice. Bronchospasm can be controlled with a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer or mask. Morphine and other strong opioids provide effective relief from chronic or refractory dyspnoea and should be offered according to established clinical protocols available in the medical literature (106–111) . Morphine also relieves cough refractory to bronchodilators, guaifenesin or non-opioid cough suppressants.\n\nÎ Is relief from pain and other symptoms offered? Paracetamol typically gives relief from mild pain. A strong opioid such as morphine should be used to treat moderate or severe pain (110–112). Antiemetics and antipyretics may be needed.\n\nÎ Is psychological support being offered? Psychological counselling for the patient and family caregivers is critical for providing emotional support and assisting patients with end-of-life decision-making. Patients should be assessed for anxiety or depression and treated whenever the assessment is positive. Any doctor with basic palliative care training should be able to diagnose and treat uncomplicated anxiety disorders, depression, and delirium (91, 95) . Patients with complex mental health problems should have virtual or in-person psychiatric evaluation.\n\nÎ Are infection control measures being applied thoroughly? A patient who is taken off anti-TB treatment because of failure often remains infectious. Infection control measures should be continued with reinforcement of environmental and personal measures, including N95 mask use for caregivers and surgical masks for patients.\n\nÎ Is there respect for patient’s beliefs and values? Every patient is different, and an acceptable quality of life for one patient would not be acceptable to another. As much as possible, the patient’s wishes for the location and type of care should be respected (10, 16, 91) . Also, it is common for patients and family caregivers to develop or increase their interest in spirituality or religion once they perceive that the end of life is approaching. Health care providers should respect those beliefs and not impose personal values and practices.\n\nÎ Has the patient received nutritional assessment and support? Small and frequent meals are often best for a person at the end of life. Nausea and vomiting should be treated, but it should be accepted that appetite and intake will decline as the patient’s condition deteriorates and during end-of-life care. Artificial nutrition, either enteral via gastric tube or parenteral, typically provides no longevity benefit and often worsens suffering from dyspnoea or oedema.\n\nÎ Is the patient being visited regularly by the TB programme ? When TB treatment stops, regular visits by health care providers and the support team should continue in order to address medical needs and to ensure that infection control practices are being followed.","tokens_est":978,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Oral care, prevention of bedsores, bathing and prevention of muscle contractures are indicated in all patients. Regular scheduled movement of the bedridden patient is very important except in the last hours of life. Encourage patients to move their bodies in bed if able to do so. Keeping beds dry and clean is also important. ENDBOX","tokens_est":115,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Palliative home care combined with strict infection control may be preferred by many patients and may be less expensive than institutional care for health care systems. Patients could be with family and friends rather than isolated in an institution that may be far from home. Those who are well enough may be able to engage with family in income-earning activities such as crafts or Internet-based businesses. However, adherence to infection control measures should be a prerequisite for remaining at home. TB programmes should explore opportunities to collaborate with local palliative care programmes to provide palliative home care for people with TB. In addition, TB programmes should build basic capacity for the estimated number of patients in need of institutionally-based end-of-life care either for medical reasons or because of the lack of relatives or community members willing to provide home care.","tokens_est":329,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Dosages were established by the GDGs for the WHO guidelines on DR-TB treatment (2018 and 2020 updates), the WHO Global Task Force on the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of TB medicines and the expert consultation on dosing convened by WHO in October 2021, following the GDG meeting on child and adolescent TB in June 2021. Doses for children and young adolescents weighing <46 kg were revised according to Annex 6 of the 2022 WHO operational handbook on tuberculosis – Module 5: Management of tuberculosis in children and adolescents (153) , which was informed by an expert consultation on dosing convened by WHO in October 2021 (154) . They are based on the most recent reviews and best practices in the treatment of ( paediatric ) MDR/RR-TB. For certain medicines the dosages were informed by pharmacokinetic modelling results based on the principle of allometric scaling and maturation (155) . Due to the pharmacokinetic properties of certain medicines the doses proposed may exceed the mg/kg/day ranges shown here in order to achieve blood concentrations similar to target levels in an average adult patient. The guidance for the 3–<5 kg weight band and for bedaquiline and delamanid is based on currently available data and may be revised when new data become available.\n[b] Dissolving of crushed adult tablets or capsule content in 10 mL of water is required for administering this dose. The number of mL in the table reflects the dose to provide. This avoids fractioning solid formulations, although bioavailability of the dissolved, crushed adult tablets is uncertain (use of dispersible tablets is preferred).\n[c] The higher dose may be used except when there is risk of toxicity; levels are expected to be lowered because of pharmacokinetic interactions, malabsorption or other reasons; or the strain has low-level drug resistance.\n[d] Bedaquiline adult tablets (100 mg) crushed and suspended in water have been shown to be bioequivalent to tablets swallowed whole. Vigorous stirring/shaking is needed prior to administering the 100 mg tablet crushed and suspended in water.\n[e] When using the 600 mg tab and the 150 mg dt to dose children weighing 16 to <24 kg, the dose in mg/kg will exceed 10–12 mg/kg and clinicians may opt to administer 1.5 dt or 4 mL of the 600 mg tab dispersed in 10 mL water.\n[f] Clofazimine tablets are technically not dispersible but they do dissolve slowly (this takes approximately 5 minutes) in water (5 mL and 10 mL for the 50 mg and 100 mg tablets, respectively). The suspension should be stirred prior to administration. The 50 mg and 100 mg soft gel capsules are difficult to swallow for young children and therefore countries are strongly encouraged to make the 50 mg tablet formulation available.\n[g] In children weighing 3 to <7 kg doses are lower than previously recommended. This is because of relatively high exposures associated with risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events, which is especially concerning when co-administering cycloserine with delamanid. h [h] Delamanid adult tablets (50 mg) crushed and suspended in water have been shown to be bioequivalent to tablets swallowed whole.\n[ i ] Amikacin and streptomycin may be used in adults aged 18 years or more, in situations where an effective regimen cannot otherwise be designed using oral agents, when susceptibility is demonstrated and when adequate measures are in place to monitor for adverse events. Given the profound impact that hearing loss can have on the acquisition of language and the ability to learn at school, the use of injectable agents in children should be exceptional and limited to salvage therapy, and the treatment needs to be provided under strict monitoring to ensure early detection of ototoxicity. If used, the weight-based daily dose for amikacin is 15–20 mg/kg and for streptomycin it is 20–40 mg/kg for children aged 2 years and older. To determine the dosing for infants and children aged below 2 years, a paediatric DR-TB expert should be consulted and a lower mg/kg dose used to compensate for immature clearance. Co-administration with lidocaine is advised to reduce pain at the injection site (156) .\n[j] These medicines are only recommended as a companion agent (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) or are not included in Groups A, B and C, because of a lack of data from the latest analysis on longer MDR-TB regimens in adults (isoniazid).\nSpecific comments on dosing children with medicines used in second-line MDR-TB regimens:\n- For dosing of premature and low birth weight infants weighing <3 kg, advice should be sought from a paediatric DR-TB expert.\n- For dosing of infants weighing 3 to <5 kg, a paediatric DR-TB expert should be consulted whenever possible.\n- The use of child-friendly, dispersible tablets in infants and young children is preferred over manipulating adult tablets or administering or manipulating capsules. Where applicable, the dosing provided is based on dissolving the dispersible formulation in 10 mL of water and administering the number of mL (aliquots). The number of mL in the table reflects the dose to provide. The dissolved solution should be used immediately and the remainder of the 10 mL should be discarded.\n- For some weight bands, dosing is indicated with both child-friendly, dispersible formulations and adult formulations. If adult formulations are used, the table provides the dose using aliquots in mL and tablet fractions where applicable (if the fraction is 0.5 or more). Aliquots refer to the volume to administer after crushing and dissolving the tablet in 10 mL of water. END","caption":"Table A4.2.
