TB tests with WHO recommendations (cont)\n\nTo detect when a person is infected with Mtb and may be most likely to benefit from receiving TPT, WHO recommends three classes of TB infection tests: TBSTs, IGRAs and TST. All three classes include tests that target factors associated with a person’s immune response to infection – they do not directly target components of Mtb . Hence, tests for TB infection require a competent immune response to produce valid results, cannot distinguish TB infection from TB disease, and cannot predict who will progress from TB infection to TB disease. Further information on the recommendations for use of these tests can be found in the WHO consolidated guidelines on tuberculosis: module 1: prevention ( 14 ). More information concerning operational considerations on testing for TB infection is outlined in Section 2.5 below.","tokens_est":216,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

However, the number of notified cases is not a good proxy for the actual number of people who develop TB disease.

Investments are needed to cover not only the cost of drugs but also the human resources for medical evaluation, TPT initiation and follow-up. Testing for TB infection will also reduce unnecessary expenditure on medication or adverse events experienced by those receiving unnecessary treatment. Hence, testing for TB infection before TPT is a valuable way to increase the TPT benefit–risk ratio.","tokens_est":208,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

Thus, depending on the specific product and setting, these tests could potentially be positioned at Level II or Level III.\n\n• Culture on liquid or solid media, or FL-LPA or SL-LPA (or both) using sputum specimens may also be applicable at this level, but such tests are gradually being superseded by more automated and rapid alternatives.\n\n• The IGRAs are also suitable for this level of the health system.

They include adults and children with signs or symptoms suggestive of TB, with a CXR showing abnormalities suggestive of TB, a positive mWRD used as a screening tool or positive C-reactive protein test (>5 mg/L) in PLHIV. A person with a positive mWRD used as a screening tool and a low pretest probability should be clinically assessed and, if deemed to be a person presumed to have TB, should have a repeat mWRD performed and follow Algorithm 1. If the pretest probability is high and the clinical picture is consistent with TB disease, then this test could be considered diagnostic and the person should be managed based on the result of the test and, if relevant, should continue on to Algorithm 2 or 3. This algorithm may also be followed for the diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB using CSF, lymph node and other tissue specimens. However, mWRDs that are recommended for use in the diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB investigations are currently limited to Xpert Ultra.\nb Programmes may consider collecting two specimens upfront. The first specimen should be promptly tested using the mWRD . The second specimen may be used for the additional testing described in this algorithm. For individuals being evaluated for pulmonary TB, sputum is the preferred specimen. Tissue biopsy samples are difficult or impossible to obtain repeatedly; therefore, they should be tested with as many methods as possible (e.g. mWRD , culture, DST or histology).\nc mWRD includes LC- aNAAT , LC- mNAAT and MC- aNAAT for the general population.\nd The concurrent testing strategy was only assessed for LC- aNAAT in combination with LF-LAM owing to lack of evidence for LC- mNAAT and MC- aNAAT . A laboratory equipped only with LC- mNAAT or MC- aNAAT can also use these tools to diagnosis both of PLHIV and children because both classes are recommended for initial diagnosis of TB of these groups. Additional testing may be required to detect RIF resistance if LC- mNAAT was used. This strategy is not covered by the concurrent testing recommendations but is a way to increase sensitivity in the diagnostic cascade without unnecessary delays. An initial positive result on any of these tests, LC- mNAAT , MC- aNAAT or LF- LAM should lead to treatment initiation.\ne Only the result from the single mWRD is available for this group.\nf LF-LAM should not be used on people who are HIV- negative.\ng “MTBC detected (if Ultra, not trace results)” includes MTBC detected as high, medium, low or very low. These categories apply to the Xpert Ultra tests. Results of the Truenat MTB and MTB Plus tests, MC- aNAAT and the TB LAMP test also fall into the category of “MTBC detected (if Ultra, not trace results)”. The MC- aNAAT provides additional resistance detection for INH and leads to additional considerations in pathway B.\nh Determination of RIF resistance occurs simultaneously in the Xpert Ultra test and the MC- aNAAT . A reflex test is needed to determine RIF resistance for Truenat testing, using the same DNA isolated for the Truenat MTB test. The TB-LAMP test requires a fresh specimen to be collected and a molecular or phenotypic DST to be conducted. In the case of MC- aNAAT , INH resistance detection also occurs simultaneously with RIF detection.\ni The interpretation and follow-up testing for MTBC detected and RIF indeterminate or unknown for the Xpert Ultra test differs from the interpretation of results for other mWRDs . MTBC detected with RIF indeterminate results obtained with the Xpert Ultra test (especially those with high and medium semiquantitative results) may be due to large deletions or multiple mutations that confer RIF resistance. Analysis of the Xpert Ultra melt curves can detect such resistance-conferring mutations. In some cases, culture and DST, sequencing or alternative mWRD will be needed to confirm or exclude RIF resistance. Indeterminate results for the other mWRDs are usually related to very low numbers of bacilli in the sample. When using an mWRD without detection of RIF resistance (e.g. TB-LAMP), further testing for RIF resistance is required preferably using an mWRD able to detect resistance.\nj “ MTBC detected trace” applies only to the Xpert Ultra test.\nk Further investigations for TB may include CXR, additional clinical assessments, repeat mWRD testing, culture or clinical response following treatment with broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents.\nl People should be initiated on a first-line regimen according to national guidelines, unless the person is at very high risk of having MDR-TB. Such people should be further investigated and initiated on an MDR-TB regimen if pertinent. In situations where INH results are available (e.g. MC- aNAAT ) and INH resistance has not been detected, the probability of having MDR-TB would be lower.\nm A sample may be sent for molecular or phenotypic DST if there is a high prevalence of INH or other drug resistance and RIF susceptible (i.e. INH monoresistance or polyresistance) in this setting. Where a result for INH resistance is “not detected” (e.g. MC- aNAAT ), and the pretest probability for Hr -TB is high, phenotypic DST for INH should be performed.\nn People at high risk for MDR-TB include people who were treated previously, including those who had been lost to follow-up, relapsed or experienced treatment failure; non-converters (smear positive at end of intensive phase); MDR-TB contacts; and any other groups at risk for MDR-TB identified in the country.\no The mWRD with RIF testing should be performed at the same testing site with a fresh specimen, and the result of the second test should be interpreted as shown in this algorithm. The RIF result from the second test is the result that should be used for clinical decisions.\np PLHIV include those who are HIV-positive or whose HIV status is unknown, but who present with strong clinical evidence of HIV infection, reside in settings where there is a high prevalence of HIV or are members of a group at risk for HIV. For all those with unknown HIV status, HIV testing should be performed according to national guidelines.\nq People should be promptly initiated on an MDR-TB regimen in accordance with national guidelines. Algorithm 2 should be followed for additional testing for any person with RR-TB.\nr Phenotypic (culture and DST) and molecular (e.g. alternate mWRDs , LPAs and targeted NGS) methods are available for evaluating drug resistance. Rapid molecular methods are preferred.\ns In people with a prior history of TB within the past 5 years or whose TB treatment was completed less than 5 years ago, Xpert Ultra trace results (and occasionally “MTBC detected low or very low”) may be false positive, not because of active TB but because of the presence of non-viable bacilli. Clinical decisions must be made based on all available information and clinical judgement.\nt People diagnosed using an MC- aNAAT and whose result is RIF resistance not detected, and INH resistance detected should be treated for Hr -TB with REZ and levofloxacin. For practical purposes, HREZ fixed-dose combination tablets may be used instead of REZ. Consider including high-dose INH in the Hr -TB regimen if low-level resistance is detected ( inhA mutation only). Follow Algorithm 3. END","caption":"Fig. 6.2.

Hence, the programme should ensure that the referral pathways and medical services are well organized before launching testing for TB infection, and that the mechanisms for clinical assessment, start of medication and treatment support are all available (Section 2). An advantage of skin testing for TB infection (using TST or TBST) is the capacity to administer the test and read the result in 48 hours at the POC. The portable nature of the supplies and temperature-controlled reagents needed for the test mean that testing can be done at home or in remote communities.

Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling predicted that a rifapentine dose of 1200 mg without food would yield an area under the curve (AUC) similar to that of a rifapentine dose of 900 mg with a high fat meal. Given that the target rifapentine AUC lies somewhere between that achieved with a very high fat meal and a rifapentine dose of 900–1200 mg, the strategy proposed was a rifapentine dose of 1200 mg with a modest food requirement, the rationale that a very high fat meal may not be feasible under routine TB care conditions, whereas dosing with food may be feasible.

A particular exception highlighted in the recommendation on timing of the ART relates to situations when signs and symptoms of meningitis are present. In general, it is recommended to start ART within 2 weeks of initiating TB treatment; however, caution is needed in people living with HIV with tuberculous meningitis, because immediate ART is significantly associated with more serious AEs. Thus, delaying ART for 4–8 weeks after initiation of TB treatment might be considered in these situations (39) .

Medicines in Group C are ranked by decreasing order of usual preference for use, subject to other considerations. The 2018 IPD meta-analysis for longer regimens included no patients on thioacetazone and high-dose isoniazid, for a meaningful analysis. No recommendation on perchlozone , interferon gamma or sutezolid was possible owing to the absence of final patient treatment outcome data from appropriate studies.\n[b] Bedaquiline is usually administered 400 mg orally once daily for the first 2 weeks, followed by 200 mg orally thrice weekly for 22 weeks (total duration of 24 weeks). As a result of multiple reviews following new data gradually becoming available, the use of bedaquiline is not restricted by age of the patient. Evidence on the safety and effectiveness of bedaquiline use beyond 6 months was insufficient for review in 2018. Therefore, the use of bedaquiline beyond 6 months was implemented following best practices in “ off-label ” use . New evidence on the safety profile of bedaquiline use beyond 6 months was available to the GDG in 2019, but the GDG was not able to assess the impact of prolonged bedaquiline use on efficacy, owing to the limited evidence and potential residual confounding in the data. However, the evidence supports the safe use of bedaquiline beyond 6 months in patients who receive appropriate schedules of baseline and follow-up monitoring. The use of bedaquiline beyond 6 months still remains as off-label use and, in this regard, best practices in off-label use still apply.\n[c] Evidence on the concurrent use of bedaquiline and delamanid was insufficient for review in 2018. In 2019, new evidence on both the safety and effectiveness of concurrent use of bedaquiline and delamanid was made available to the GDG. In relation to safety, the GDG concluded that the data suggested no additional safety concerns regarding concurrent use of bedaquiline and delamanid. More evidence was added to that regard between 2020 and 2022 . Both medicines may be used concurrently in patients who have limited other treatment options available to them, and if sufficient monitoring (including baseline and follow-up ECG and electrolyte monitoring) is in place. The data on the effectiveness of concurrent use of bedaquiline and delamanid were reviewed by the GDG in 2019, but owing to the limited evidence and potential residual confounding in the data, the GDG could not proceed with a recommendation on effectiveness.\n[d] Use of linezolid for at least 6 months was shown to increase effectiveness, although toxicity may limit its use. The analysis suggested that using linezolid for the whole duration of treatment would optimize its effect (about 70% of patients on linezolid with data received it for more than 6 months, and 30% for 18 months or the whole duration). No patient predictors for early cessation of linezolid could be inferred from the IPD subanalysis .\n[e] Evidence on the safety and effectiveness of delamanid beyond 6 months was insufficient for review. The use of delamanid beyond these limits should follow best practices in “ off-label ” use. As a result of multiple reviews following new data gradually becoming available throughout the years the use of delamanid is not restricted by age of the patient.\n[f ] Pyrazinamide is only counted as an effective agent when DST results confirm susceptibility.\n[g] Every dose of imipenem– cilastatin or meropenem should be preceded by the oral administration of oral clavulanic acid 30–60 minutes beforehand; oral clavulanic acid is only available in formulations combined with amoxicillin. Amoxicillin–clavulanic acid is not counted as an additional effective TB agent and should not be used without imipenem– cilastatin or meropenem.\n[h] Amikacin and streptomycin are only to be considered if DST results confirm susceptibility and high-quality audiology monitoring for hearing loss can be ensured. Streptomycin is to be considered only if amikacin cannot be used (unavailable or documented resistance) and if DST results confirm susceptibility (streptomycin resistance is not detectable with second-line molecular LPAs and phenotypic DST is required). Kanamycin and capreomycin are no longer recommended for use in MDR-TB regimens.\n[ i ] These agents only showed effectiveness in regimens without bedaquiline, linezolid, clofazimine or delamanid and are thus only proposed when other options to compose a regimen are not possible.

Also worth considering is the long half-life of the drug (5.5 months), which may lead to the drug acting as monotherapy in patients lost to follow-up. FQ resistance testing should be performed to prevent bedaquiline resistance acquisition, and the levels of resistance should be monitored when possible. Bedaquiline presents cross-resistance with clofazimine in cases of Rv0678 gene mutation (which lead to upregulation of efflux pumps) and pepQ mutations.

Movements of eyes, mouth, eyebrows, forehead or even nostrils in different combinations signal happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, fear and interest. A slightly furrowed forehead will usually mean that the person either disagrees with what is being said or does not understand. That simple expression alone can show that they need more explanation. Because tension and anxiety may be reflected in body language, a reasonable guess at a person’s state of mind can be made simply from looking at their posture. People who are anxious or worried about something tend to adopt characteristically tense positions of the hands, which may be clasped tightly together, or of legs, which may be wrapped around each other or the feet may tap repeatedly on the floor. Often without the need for any words, these clues can alert an observant health care provider to investigate further.","tokens_est":245,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module4_treatment_2025_manifest.xlsx"}

In addition to the creation of further resistance, continued treatment in this situation also uses resources that may be very scarce.

If the clinical team decides together that treatment should be suspended, a clear plan should be prepared for approaching the patient and the family. This process usually requires personal interaction with patient and family, ideally including home visits, and may take several weeks. It is not recommended to suspend therapy before the patient understands and accepts the reasons to do so, agrees with a change in goals of care to optimizing quality of life and comfort, and accepts palliative care.

Doses for children and young adolescents weighing <46 kg were revised according to Annex 6 of the 2022 WHO operational handbook on tuberculosis – Module 5: Management of tuberculosis in children and adolescents (153) , which was informed by an expert consultation on dosing convened by WHO in October 2021 (154) . They are based on the most recent reviews and best practices in the treatment of ( paediatric ) MDR/RR-TB. For certain medicines the dosages were informed by pharmacokinetic modelling results based on the principle of allometric scaling and maturation (155) . Due to the pharmacokinetic properties of certain medicines the doses proposed may exceed the mg/kg/day ranges shown here in order to achieve blood concentrations similar to target levels in an average adult patient. The guidance for the 3–<5 kg weight band and for bedaquiline and delamanid is based on currently available data and may be revised when new data become available.\n[b] Dissolving of crushed adult tablets or capsule content in 10 mL of water is required for administering this dose.

This avoids fractioning solid formulations, although bioavailability of the dissolved, crushed adult tablets is uncertain (use of dispersible tablets is preferred).\n[c] The higher dose may be used except when there is risk of toxicity; levels are expected to be lowered because of pharmacokinetic interactions, malabsorption or other reasons; or the strain has low-level drug resistance.\n[d] Bedaquiline adult tablets (100 mg) crushed and suspended in water have been shown to be bioequivalent to tablets swallowed whole. Vigorous stirring/shaking is needed prior to administering the 100 mg tablet crushed and suspended in water.\n[e] When using the 600 mg tab and the 150 mg dt to dose children weighing 16 to <24 kg, the dose in mg/kg will exceed 10–12 mg/kg and clinicians may opt to administer 1.5 dt or 4 mL of the 600 mg tab dispersed in 10 mL water.\n[f] Clofazimine tablets are technically not dispersible but they do dissolve slowly (this takes approximately 5 minutes) in water (5 mL and 10 mL for the 50 mg and 100 mg tablets, respectively). The suspension should be stirred prior to administration. The 50 mg and 100 mg soft gel capsules are difficult to swallow for young children and therefore countries are strongly encouraged to make the 50 mg tablet formulation available.\n[g] In children weighing 3 to <7 kg doses are lower than previously recommended. This is because of relatively high exposures associated with risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events, which is especially concerning when co-administering cycloserine with delamanid. h [h] Delamanid adult tablets (50 mg) crushed and suspended in water have been shown to be bioequivalent to tablets swallowed whole.\n[ i ] Amikacin and streptomycin may be used in adults aged 18 years or more, in situations where an effective regimen cannot otherwise be designed using oral agents, when susceptibility is demonstrated and when adequate measures are in place to monitor for adverse events. Given the profound impact that hearing loss can have on the acquisition of language and the ability to learn at school, the use of injectable agents in children should be exceptional and limited to salvage therapy, and the treatment needs to be provided under strict monitoring to ensure early detection of ototoxicity. If used, the weight-based daily dose for amikacin is 15–20 mg/kg and for streptomycin it is 20–40 mg/kg for children aged 2 years and older. To determine the dosing for infants and children aged below 2 years, a paediatric DR-TB expert should be consulted and a lower mg/kg dose used to compensate for immature clearance. Co-administration with lidocaine is advised to reduce pain at the injection site (156) .\n[j] These medicines are only recommended as a companion agent (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) or are not included in Groups A, B and C, because of a lack of data from the latest analysis on longer MDR-TB regimens in adults (isoniazid).\nSpecific comments on dosing children with medicines used in second-line MDR-TB regimens:\n- For dosing of premature and low birth weight infants weighing <3 kg, advice should be sought from a paediatric DR-TB expert.\n- For dosing of infants weighing 3 to <5 kg, a paediatric DR-TB expert should be consulted whenever possible.\n- The use of child-friendly, dispersible tablets in infants and young children is preferred over manipulating adult tablets or administering or manipulating capsules. Where applicable, the dosing provided is based on dissolving the dispersible formulation in 10 mL of water and administering the number of mL (aliquots). The number of mL in the table reflects the dose to provide. The dissolved solution should be used immediately and the remainder of the 10 mL should be discarded.\n- For some weight bands, dosing is indicated with both child-friendly, dispersible formulations and adult formulations. If adult formulations are used, the table provides the dose using aliquots in mL and tablet fractions where applicable (if the fraction is 0.5 or more). Aliquots refer to the volume to administer after crushing and dissolving the tablet in 10 mL of water. END","caption":"Table A4.2.

A regimen consists of two phases – the intensive and continuation phases. The number at the front of each phase represents the duration of that phase in months. For example, 2HRZE consists of treatment with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol for 2 months.\n[b] In settings with a high HIV prevalence and/or a high isoniazid resistance prevalence, ethambutol should be added to the intensive phase of treatment. High HIV prevalence settings are defined as HIV prevalence ≥1% among adult pregnant women or ≥5% among people with TB. Thresholds for low, moderate or high levels of isoniazid resistance prevalence are established by country NTPs.\n[c] The SHINE trial was a non-inferiority trial that compared a 4-month regimen (2HRZ(E)/2HR) with a 6-month regimen (2HRZ(E)/4HR). The 4-month regimen was shown to be non-inferior. Therefore, the 6-month regimen may also be used for children with non-severe PTB if the 4-month regimen has not been adopted .\n[d] This regimen applies regardless of HIV prevalence and prevalence of isoniazid resistance.\n[e] This regimen applies to older adolescents regardless of disease severity, HIV prevalence and prevalence of isoniazid resistance.\n[f] This regimen applies to older adolescents regardless of disease severity, HIV prevalence and prevalence of isoniazid resistance, except for people weighing less than 40 kg and adolescents living with HIV with a CD4 count below 100 cells/mm 3 .

Subsequently, the senior treatment supervisor would ensure the availability of medicines at the child’s local public health facility within 1–2 days.\n\nIn rural and some urban areas, TB medicines were delivered to patients’ homes by frontline health workers (accredited social health activists or TB health visitors) or a local nongovernmental organization engaged as a patient provider support agency.","caption":"Box 6.8 The Catalyzing Pediatric Tuberculosis Innovation project: enabling access to public paediatric TB medicines for private-sector patients in India – translating policy into action","tokens_est":245,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module5_pediatrics_2022_manifest.xlsx"}

The family may need support to care for the child throughout the treatment period and to make preparations for end-of-life care if the prognosis is poor (204) .","tokens_est":163,"source_manifest":"..\\rag-chunker\\manifests\\WHO_TB_handbook_module5_pediatrics_2022_manifest.xlsx"}

It is most useful for young children who are hospitalized. Gastric aspirates are collected from young children with presumed pulmonary TB (PTB).
